This significant upward movement captures the attention of investors and enthusiasts globally. According to recent Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is now trading impressively at $112,018.34 on the Binance USDT market. This surge highlights a robust momentum for the world’s leading digital asset. What’s Driving This Phenomenal Bitcoin Price Rally? This recent ascent in Bitcoin price is not an isolated event; several factors often contribute to such significant market movements. Investors are closely watching for potential catalysts that fuel this kind of growth. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. Increased Institutional Interest: More large financial institutions are showing interest and allocating capital to Bitcoin. This often signals growing mainstream acceptance. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties can sometimes push investors towards Bitcoin as a perceived safe-haven asset, similar to gold. Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity, especially post-halving events, can create upward price pressure when demand increases. Technological Advancements: Ongoing developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem, improving its utility and scalability, also contribute to positive sentiment. How Does the Current Bitcoin Price Impact the Broader Market? When the Bitcoin price experiences such a strong rally, it often has a ripple effect across the entire cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s dominance can influence altcoin performance, creating both opportunities and challenges for other digital assets. Many altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s lead. Therefore, a sustained rise in BTC can pull other cryptocurrencies upwards. However, it can also lead to capital flowing out of altcoins and into Bitcoin as investors chase the primary asset’s gains. This dynamic requires careful observation from traders and long-term holders alike. Navigating Volatility: What Should Investors Consider with This Bitcoin Price? While the current Bitcoin price action is exciting, it is important to remember that cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Prices can fluctuate significantly, and rapid gains can be followed by swift corrections. Informed decision-making is key. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider their risk tolerance. Diversifying portfolios and understanding market trends can help mitigate potential risks. Staying updated on market news and expert analysis is also a valuable strategy for navigating these dynamic conditions. Stay Informed: Regularly monitor market news and analysis from reputable sources. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Define your investment strategy clearly. Security: Ensure your holdings are secure in reliable wallets or exchanges. The surge in Bitcoin price above $112,000 marks a significant moment for the crypto world. This impressive rally underscores the growing maturity and appeal of digital assets. While the future remains unpredictable, the current momentum signals strong confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. As the market continues to evolve, staying engaged and informed will be paramount for all participants.

      "body": "BitcoinWorld Spot Ethereum ETFs: Goldman Sachs’ Staggering $721M Investment Signals Major Shift The world of traditional finance is buzzing with a remarkable development: global investment giant Goldman Sachs has made a significant foray into the digital asset space. Reports confirm that Goldman Sachs now holds an astounding $721 million in spot Ethereum ETFs , marking the largest institutional position recorded to date. This bold move signals a powerful shift in how established financial players view cryptocurrency, particularly Ethereum. Goldman Sachs Leads the Charge in Spot Ethereum ETFs Recent U.S. 13F securities filings, brought to light by Cointelegraph via X, reveal Goldman Sachs’ substantial commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem. Their $721 million holding in spot Ethereum ETFs isn’t just a large number; it positions them as the leading institutional investor in this nascent yet rapidly growing sector. This kind of investment from a titan like Goldman Sachs lends immense credibility to Ethereum as a legitimate asset class. For those unfamiliar, 13F filings are mandatory quarterly reports filed by institutional investment managers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings disclose their equity holdings, offering a transparent look into the strategies of major financial entities. The fact that Goldman Sachs’ holdings are now public knowledge underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Why Are Institutions Embracing Spot Ethereum ETFs? The appeal of spot Ethereum ETFs for institutional investors is multi-faceted. These exchange-traded funds offer a regulated and accessible way for large financial firms to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly holding the underlying cryptocurrency. This bypasses many of the operational complexities and regulatory uncertainties associated with direct crypto ownership, such as secure storage, compliance, and direct market access. Key benefits for institutional adoption include: Regulated Access: ETFs operate within established financial frameworks, providing a familiar and compliant investment vehicle. Liquidity: Trading on traditional exchanges offers superior liquidity compared to some direct crypto markets. Diversification: Adding Ethereum exposure allows institutions to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional assets. Ease of Management: ETFs simplify the investment process, reducing the burden of self-custody and technical challenges. Moreover, the approval and trading of these ETFs signify a growing maturity in the crypto market, providing a bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy. Beyond Goldman Sachs: Other Major Players in Ethereum ETFs While Goldman Sachs holds the top spot, they are certainly not alone in recognizing the potential of spot Ethereum ETFs . Other significant institutional players are also making their mark: Jane Street: This prominent quantitative trading firm holds a notable $190 million in spot Ethereum ETFs. Millennium Management: Another major hedge fund, Millennium Management, has invested $186 million in these same ETFs. These substantial investments from multiple reputable firms highlight a broader trend. It indicates a collective institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition and its role in the evolving digital landscape. The collective interest from such diverse and influential financial entities suggests that institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum, is accelerating. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto? The significant institutional interest in spot Ethereum ETFs carries profound implications for the entire cryptocurrency market. This influx of capital from major financial institutions can lead to: Increased Liquidity: More institutional money generally means deeper markets and greater trading volumes. Market Validation: Endorsement from firms like Goldman Sachs adds legitimacy and can attract further mainstream investment. Price Stability: Large, long-term institutional holdings can potentially contribute to greater price stability over time, reducing extreme volatility. Regulatory Clarity: The demand from institutions often pushes regulators towards developing clearer frameworks, which benefits the entire ecosystem. However, it is also important to consider potential challenges, such as increased market correlation with traditional assets and the ongoing need for robust regulatory oversight. Investors should always conduct their own research and consider the inherent volatility of the crypto market. In conclusion, Goldman Sachs’ monumental $721 million investment in spot Ethereum ETFs, alongside other major players, underscores a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market. This move not only validates Ethereum as a serious investment asset but also accelerates its integration into mainstream finance. The future looks increasingly intertwined for traditional financial powerhouses and the innovative world of digital assets, with spot Ethereum ETFs acting as a crucial bridge.

      "body": "Instead of chasing quick returns, a growing conversation in crypto is shifting toward how digital assets can be used in more strategic ways. One of the clearest voices on this point is Cypress Demanincor (@CDemanincor), a crypto expert on X, who recently explained how XRP can be managed using the same wealth strategies employed by traditional elites. His view is that the real advantage lies in treating XRP as an appreciating asset to be collateralized, rather than sold, and not in seeking short-term gains. $XRP HOLDERS LISTEN UP People who keep saying “the yield is too small” you’re missing the point. It’s not about chasing crazy yields. It’s about adopting the same wealth strategies the elites have used for decades: using your assets as collateral instead of selling them.… https://t.co/hgBFvlf19w — Cypress Demanincor (@CDemanincor) August 26, 2025 The Elite Approach to Assets Demanincor emphasized that established financial practices among high-net-worth individuals rely less on selling appreciating assets and more on using them as collateral. He noted that “it’s not about chasing crazy yields” but about adopting wealth-building methods that have been employed for decades. In traditional markets, this approach is evident in equities, real estate, and even alternative assets such as art and bonds. Owners of these assets do not typically liquidate when they need liquidity. Instead, they secure credit lines against their holdings, thereby maintaining long-term exposure while gaining access to cash. Experts have consistently advised against selling XRP , and applying this strategy to crypto investments can help XRP holders retain their assets while addressing immediate financial needs. This keeps investors positioned for potential future gains while avoiding the disadvantages of selling during periods of volatility or at inopportune times. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 How Collateralization Works with XRP The concept presented by Demanincor can be summarized as an expansion of established wealth management strategies into digital assets. For example, an individual holding $20,000 in XRP who faces an unexpected $10,000 expense would previously have had little choice but to liquidate part of their position. Under the collateralization model, however, that same investor can borrow against their holdings. This approach preserves exposure to XRP’s future trajectory while also supplying liquidity when needed. A Long-Term Wealth Model for Crypto Investors This approach mirrors strategies long employed by wealthy investors, who borrow against appreciating assets rather than selling them. In traditional finance, it takes the form of margin loans for equities or home equity credit in real estate. With crypto, similar tools now exist for retail investors. Lending XRP to banks or institutions that need it could be a profitable way to earn passive income, and is just one of many methods XRP holders can employ. With the asset’s supply shrinking , XRP’s scarcity could increase its value over time. This makes Demanincor’s approach even more relevant, as collateralizing XRP allows holders to access liquidity while maintaining exposure to potential appreciation, ensuring they benefit from long-term growth rather than selling too early.

      "title": "Crypto Liquidations: Shocking $161M Wipeout in Perpetual Futures",
      "url": "https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-liquidations-wipeout/",
      "body": "BitcoinWorld Crypto Liquidations: Shocking $161M Wipeout in Perpetual Futures The cryptocurrency market witnessed a significant event recently, with over $161 million in crypto perpetual futures liquidations occurring within a single 24-hour period. This massive wipeout left many traders reeling, highlighting the inherent volatility and risks associated with leveraged trading in digital assets. Understanding these sudden market shifts is crucial for anyone involved in crypto, as they often signal broader market movements and potential dangers. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations in Perpetual Futures? When we talk about crypto liquidations , we are referring to the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This happens when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement, typically due to adverse price movements. Perpetual futures contracts, unlike traditional futures, have no expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely as long as they meet margin requirements. However, this flexibility comes with increased risk, especially when using high leverage. Essentially, if the market moves strongly against a trader’s leveraged bet, the exchange automatically sells off their assets to cover potential losses. This mechanism protects both the exchange and other traders, preventing the account balance from going negative. Consequently, it can be devastating for the individual experiencing the liquidation, often leading to significant capital loss. The Recent $161 Million Crypto Liquidations: Who Was Hit Hardest? The recent 24-hour period saw a staggering $161 million in crypto liquidations across various major cryptocurrencies. Let’s break down the impact on some key players: Bitcoin (BTC): Approximately $36.07 million in BTC positions were liquidated. A significant 62.68% of these were long positions, meaning traders betting on a price increase were caught off guard by a downturn. Ethereum (ETH): ETH liquidations were even higher, reaching $97.41 million. Similar to BTC, long positions accounted for a substantial 64.97%, indicating a strong market reversal against bullish bets. Solana (SOL): SOL experienced $27.78 million in liquidations. Interestingly, for SOL, short positions made up 56.48% of the total, suggesting traders betting on a price decrease were squeezed as SOL saw an unexpected upward movement or failed to drop as anticipated. Why Such Sudden Crypto Liquidations Occur? Several factors contribute to these rapid crypto liquidations . Market volatility is, of course, a primary driver. Cryptocurrencies are known for their dramatic price swings, which can quickly erode margin balances on leveraged positions. Other contributing elements include: High Leverage: Many traders use high leverage, magnifying both potential gains and losses. A small price movement can lead to a large percentage loss on the leveraged capital, triggering a liquidation. Market Manipulation or ‘Wick’ Hunts: Sometimes, large players can execute trades designed to push prices briefly to trigger liquidation levels, benefiting from the cascade of forced sales. Unexpected News or Macro Events: Global economic news, regulatory announcements, or even major project updates can cause sudden shifts in market sentiment, leading to rapid price changes and subsequent liquidations. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights to Avoid Crypto Liquidations While crypto liquidations are an inherent risk of leveraged trading, traders can adopt strategies to mitigate their exposure: Manage Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessively high leverage, especially in volatile markets. Lower leverage provides a larger buffer against price swings. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to automatically close a position if it reaches a predetermined loss level, protecting your capital. Monitor Market Conditions: Stay informed about market news, technical indicators, and broader economic trends that could influence crypto prices. Understand Margin Requirements: Be aware of the initial and maintenance margin requirements of your chosen exchange and manage your account balance accordingly. Diversify and Don’t Over-Commit: Avoid putting all your capital into a single highly leveraged position. Diversification and responsible position sizing are key to long-term success. The recent $161 million in crypto liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of the high stakes in perpetual futures trading. While the allure of amplified gains is strong, the reality of sudden losses due to leverage and market volatility is ever-present. By understanding the mechanisms behind liquidations and implementing robust risk management strategies, traders can better navigate these turbulent waters and protect their investments. Stay informed, trade responsibly, and prioritize capital preservation in the dynamic world of crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are crypto perpetual futures? Crypto perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date. 2. How do crypto liquidations work? Liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position can no longer meet the margin requirements of the exchange. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, usually when the market moves significantly against the trader’s bet. 3. Why were long positions liquidated more for BTC and ETH? For BTC and ETH, a higher percentage of long positions were liquidated, indicating that a significant number of traders were betting on price increases. When the market experienced a downturn, these bullish bets were caught off guard, leading to forced closures. 4. Why were short positions liquidated for SOL? For SOL, short positions accounted for a majority of liquidations. This suggests that traders betting on a price decrease were squeezed, possibly due to an unexpected upward price movement or a failure of the price to drop as anticipated, forcing them to close their positions at a loss. 5. How can traders protect themselves from liquidations? Traders can protect themselves by managing leverage wisely, setting stop-loss orders, monitoring market conditions closely, understanding margin requirements, and diversifying their portfolios to avoid over-commitment to single positions. 6. What is the impact of large-scale crypto liquidations on the market? Large-scale liquidations can exacerbate market volatility, as forced sales can create further downward (or upward) pressure, leading to a cascade effect. They can also indicate a shift in market sentiment or the presence of significant market events. Did this article help you understand the dynamics of crypto liquidations?

      "url": "https://bitcoinworld.co.in/stablecoins-korea-discussion/",
      "body": "BitcoinWorld Stablecoins: Bank of Korea Unveils Crucial Discussions with Government Agencies The financial world is buzzing with news from South Korea, where the Bank of Korea (BoK) is actively engaging in crucial discussions surrounding stablecoins with various government agencies. This development signals a significant step towards clarifying the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the nation. Why Are Stablecoins a Hot Topic in Korea? Stablecoins are a unique class of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or a commodity. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, their inherent stability makes them attractive for everyday transactions and remittances. Globally, central banks and regulators are scrutinizing stablecoins due to their growing popularity. They present both opportunities for financial innovation and potential risks to financial stability if not properly managed. The Bank of Korea, therefore, is proactively addressing these complex issues to ensure a secure and efficient financial system. Crucial Stablecoin Discussions: What’s on the Table? On August 28, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong confirmed that the central bank is deeply involved in discussions with other relevant government bodies regarding stablecoin -related matters. This collaborative effort, as reported by iNews24, aims to develop a comprehensive framework. Specifically, several key areas are under consideration: Regulatory Clarity: A primary focus is establishing clear rules for issuing and operating stablecoins . This includes licensing requirements, capital reserves, and consumer protection measures. Financial Stability: Agencies are examining how widespread adoption of stablecoins could impact Korea’s monetary policy and overall financial stability. They are also assessing potential systemic risks. Consumer Protection: Safeguarding users from fraud, market manipulation, and potential issuer insolvency is a key concern. Discussions likely cover mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability. Innovation vs. Control: Finding a balance between fostering technological innovation in the crypto space and maintaining regulatory oversight is a delicate act. The Potential Impact of Stablecoin Regulation in Korea The outcome of these discussions could significantly shape Korea’s digital asset ecosystem. Robust regulation for stablecoins could bring several benefits to the market and its participants. Increased Trust: Clear rules can boost public confidence in digital assets, potentially leading to broader adoption and integration into mainstream finance. Economic Efficiency: Well-regulated stablecoins could facilitate faster and cheaper cross-border payments, benefiting businesses and individuals. Market Maturation: A defined regulatory environment helps the market mature, attracting more institutional investors and legitimate businesses. However, there are also challenges. Overly strict regulations might stifle innovation or push crypto activities offshore. Therefore, striking the right balance is paramount for the future of digital currency in Korea. What Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Currency? The Bank of Korea’s engagement in stablecoin discussions reflects a broader global trend where central banks are acknowledging the growing influence of digital assets. These conversations are not just about control; they are about understanding and integrating new financial technologies responsibly. Actionable Insight: Businesses and individuals involved with cryptocurrencies in Korea should closely monitor these developments. Future policies could impact how stablecoins are used, traded, and regulated. Global Context: Korea’s approach to stablecoins could set a precedent for other nations in Asia, influencing regional and international regulatory trends. Ultimately, these ongoing dialogues aim to create a secure, innovative, and compliant environment for stablecoins within Korea’s financial system. The central bank’s proactive stance is a testament to its commitment to navigating the evolving digital finance landscape thoughtfully. Conclusion: The Bank of Korea’s active engagement with government agencies on stablecoins marks a pivotal moment for South Korea’s digital economy. These crucial discussions are laying the groundwork for a future where digital currencies can thrive responsibly, balancing innovation with essential regulatory oversight. As these conversations progress, the world watches to see how Korea will shape its approach to this transformative financial technology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are stablecoins?

      "body": "TL;DR The .pi Domain Auction aims to provide pioneers with personalized options for easier identity and app access. PI’s price continues to struggle, sliding to about $0.33. The upcoming token unlocks and the increased amount of coins stored on exchanges intensify the selling pressure, though rumors of a potential Coinbase listing keep hopes for a rebound alive. Information About the Upcoming Feature The team behind Pi Network issued another announcement regarding the .pi Domain Auction. It reminded that the platform-level utility “directly harnesses the collective resources of the Pi community,” including its attention and authenticity. Having said that, the developers expect the campaign to be successful. The auction is a bidding event that will enable Pioneers to acquire unique .pi domain names. These will replace the users’ long addresses, consisting of numerous letters and numbers, and will be similar in concept to .eth (Ethereum Name Services) and .bnb (BSC Name Services). “Designed for active use, .pi domains become recognizable access points for apps in the ecosystem, making it simple for others to find, use, and share,” the team said . Earlier this month, Pi Network reminded Pioneers that the auction has been extended to September 30, 2025, allowing them more time to innovate, build, and bid for their applications. The latest disclosure was met with mixed feelings. Some community members argued that the crypto project has much bigger problems to solve rather than focus on such a development. Others, though, praised the initiative, claiming it can generate more trust if delivered on time. PI’s Price Decline Despite the frequent developments surrounding the controversial project, the price of the native token has continued to sink. During the latest correction of the cryptocurrency market, PI plummeted to a new all-time low of roughly $0.33, representing a staggering 90% decline compared to the historical peak of around $3 witnessed in February. Factors like the multi-million token unlock scheduled for the next 30 days and the rising amount of coins stored on crypto exchanges increase the selling pressure. Contrary to the bearish landscape, there are still optimists who believe PI could reclaim its former peak and even surpass it. Additionally, there have been increased rumors that Coinbase may soon offer trading services for the asset. Such a move will most likely trigger a significant price surge, but as of this writing, there is no official announcement.

      "body": "Ethereum price started a fresh decline from the $4,630 zone. ETH is now showing bearish signs and might decline further below $4,460. Ethereum is struggling to settle above the $4,630 zone. The price is trading below $4,580 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a rising channel with support at $4,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start another increase unless there is a close below $4,460 in the near term. Ethereum Price Faces Hurdles Ethereum price started a downside correction and tested the $4,310 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price found support and recently started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $4,400 and $4,420 levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $4,956 swing high to the $4,310 low. However, the bears were active near the $4,630 resistance zone. The 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $4,956 swing high to the $4,310 low is acting as a hurdle. Recently, there was a break below a rising channel with support at $4,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,580 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,580 level. The next key resistance is near the $4,630 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,710 level. A clear move above the $4,710 resistance might send the price toward the $4,820 resistance. An upside break above the $4,820 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,880 resistance zone or even $5,000 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,630 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,460 level. The first major support sits near the $4,420 zone. A clear move below the $4,420 support might push the price toward the $4,310 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,240 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $4,150. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

      "body": "BitcoinWorld Infini Founder ETH Sale: Massive $11.7M Liquidation Raises Questions The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with recent revelations concerning a significant transaction. On-chain data suggests a substantial Infini founder ETH sale , specifically from Christian, the founder of the stablecoin neobank project Infini. This development has sparked considerable discussion and speculation within the crypto community, highlighting the constant scrutiny that high-profile figures face in the transparent world of blockchain. Unpacking the Infini Founder ETH Sale: The Details According to diligent on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, an address linked to Infini founder Christian appears to have offloaded a staggering 2,477 ETH. This amount translates to approximately $11.66 million at the time of the transaction, which occurred roughly ten hours ago. Such a large movement of assets naturally draws attention and raises questions about its motivations and potential impact. Let’s break down how this massive transaction unfolded: Decentralized Exchange Activity: A significant portion, 1,257 wrapped Ethereum (wETH), was sold on CowSwap, a decentralized exchange. The average sale price for this segment was reported at $4,777.6 per wETH. Centralized Exchange Deposit: The remaining 1,220 ETH was subsequently deposited into Binance, one of the world’s largest centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. The analyst’s report indicates that if the ETH deposited into Binance is also sold, Christian’s address would have entirely liquidated its Ethereum holdings. This complete exit from an asset position by a project founder is a notable event. Why Does This Infini Founder ETH Sale Grab Headlines? Anytime a founder, especially of a relatively new project like Infini, makes such a substantial move, it sends ripples. Transparency is a double-edged sword in crypto; while it allows for public verification, it also exposes individuals to intense scrutiny. This specific Infini founder ETH sale event is no exception. What are some of the immediate concerns? Project Stability: Large sales by founders can sometimes signal a lack of confidence in their own project’s long-term prospects or personal financial needs. Market Sentiment: Such transactions can influence investor perception and potentially impact the market value of related tokens or the broader crypto ecosystem. Transparency vs. Privacy: It underscores the ongoing debate between on-chain transparency and an individual’s right to financial privacy, even for public figures. Understanding On-Chain Analysis: How Do We Know? The ability to track such transactions stems from the inherent transparency of blockchain technology. On-chain analysts like ai_9684xtpa utilize publicly available data to trace asset movements. They identify wallets associated with known entities and monitor their activity. This process allows the community to gain insights into the financial actions of key players. This level of transparency is a core tenet of decentralized finance (DeFi). It empowers the community to: Verify transactions without intermediaries. Monitor large movements that could affect market dynamics. Hold project founders accountable for their actions. What Are the Potential Ramifications of the Infini Founder ETH Sale? While the reasons behind Christian’s substantial ETH sale remain speculative, the event itself carries potential implications. It could be a strategic personal financial decision, unrelated to Infini’s health. Alternatively, it might suggest a shift in the founder’s investment strategy or even a need for liquidity. For Infini and its community, this news prompts questions about the project’s future direction and the founder’s continued involvement. It is crucial for projects to communicate clearly during such times to maintain investor trust and confidence. Conclusion: Navigating Crypto’s Transparent Waters The reported Infini founder ETH sale serves as a stark reminder of the transparent yet often complex nature of the cryptocurrency market. While on-chain data offers unprecedented insight, interpreting these movements requires careful consideration and context. Investors and community members must stay informed, relying on verified information and critical analysis rather than succumbing to immediate speculation. This event underscores the importance of due diligence and understanding the motivations behind significant transactions in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. As the market matures, the interplay between founder actions, on-chain transparency, and community perception will continue to shape its trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions About the Infini Founder ETH Sale Here are some common questions regarding this significant cryptocurrency event: Q1: Who is Christian, and what is Infini? A1: Christian is identified as the founder of Infini, a stablecoin neobank project. Infini aims to provide banking services utilizing stablecoins. Q2: What exactly happened with the ETH sale? A2: An address linked to Christian reportedly sold 2,477 ETH, valued at approximately $11.66 million. Part of this was sold on CowSwap, and the rest was deposited into Binance. Q3: How was this transaction discovered? A3: The transaction was discovered and reported by on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa, who tracks and interprets publicly available data on blockchain networks. Q4: Does this sale mean Infini is in trouble? A4: Not necessarily. While a large founder sale can raise concerns, the exact reasons are unknown. It could be a personal financial decision, a strategic portfolio adjustment, or something else entirely. Projects often need to provide clear communication in such situations. Q5: What is the significance of depositing ETH into Binance? A5: Depositing a large amount of ETH into a centralized exchange like Binance often precedes a sale. If the deposited amount is sold, it would mean the address has fully liquidated its ETH position. Was this insight into the Infini founder ETH sale helpful?

      "title": "Bitcoin Strategy Deepens As Metaplanet Plans $880 Million Raise",
      "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-strategy-metaplanet-880-million/",
      "body": "Japanese investment firm Metaplanet today announced plans to raise another 130 billion yen ($880 million) through an international share sale. Of that amount, the firm intends to allocate roughly $835 million toward purchasing additional Bitcoin (BTC). Metaplanet Eyes More Bitcoin Purchases According to a regulatory filing , Tokyo-based Metaplanet has approved a plan to raise as much as $880 million, with nearly $837 million set aside for fresh BTC acquisitions. To generate the funds, the company will issue 555 million new shares. This issuance could increase the number of Metaplanet’s outstanding shares from 722 million to approximately 1.27 billion. Often referred to as “Japan’s MicroStrategy,” Metaplanet has emerged as one of Asia’s most prominent corporate Bitcoin holders. Data from CoinGecko shows the firm currently ranks as the world’s 8th largest public company by BTC reserves, holding 18,991 BTC on its balance sheet. The firm noted that proceeds from the offering will be used between September and October 2025 to accumulate Bitcoin. In addition, around $43.9 million will be reserved for other Bitcoin-related financial operations. It is important to highlight that the share sale will take place exclusively on international markets. In the US, sales will be restricted to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the US Securities Act. Metaplanet’s latest BTC purchase came earlier this week when the firm announced it had bought 103 BTC worth more than $11 million. At present, Metaplanet’s total BTC holdings are valued around $2 billion. The firm plans to hold 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. The firm’s strategy reflects a broader trend of corporations integrating Bitcoin into their treasuries. Healthcare company KindlyMD, recently announced a $5 billion stock sale to expand its BTC reserves. Commenting on the development, David Bailey, CEO, KindlyMD, said that the move to raise $5 billion is a natural next step following the firm’s initial purchase of 5,744 BTC earlier this month. On the CoinGecko list, KindlyMD currently ranks 16th in terms of total BTC held. Is BTC On The Verge Of Supply Crunch? BTC’s fixed supply of 21 million coins remains one of its most defining features. However, a significant portion of these coins has been lost in unrecoverable wallets, further reducing the effective circulating supply. As a result, a quiet race has begun among corporations, institutional investors, and even nation-states to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible before prices climb further. Recently, a congressman in the Philippines introduced a bill proposing the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the nation. Meanwhile, Dutch crypto services company Amdax announced plans last week to launch a public Bitcoin treasury firm, while Nasdaq-listed Top Win International disclosed a $10 million raise for BTC purchases. In similar news, Turkish mobility app Marti Technologies stated last month that it will hold 20% of its cash reserves in Bitcoin. At press time, BTC trades at $112,013, up 1.9% in the past 24 hours.",

      "body": "Crypto projects almost never break into mainstream visibility before their tokens are listed on exchanges. Most depend on whitepapers, developer conferences, and presale updates to slowly gain credibility. BlockDAG has rewritten that script. With a sponsorship deal with Inter Milan, plus partnerships in rugby and cricket, the project has already stepped into the spotlight, positioning itself not only as a blockchain but as a brand with consumer presence. This early move into cultural visibility adds a new layer to the story. With more than $385M raised, 25.5B coins sold, and 200,000 holders already on board, BlockDAG is proving it can establish credibility both within crypto and with millions of sports fans. Analysts argue that this kind of visibility, so early in its lifecycle, is rare, and could drive a wave of retail participation. Sports Partnerships as a Branding Engine Inter Milan, one of Europe’s most recognizable football clubs, puts BlockDAG’s name in stadiums and on screens seen by millions every week. Beyond Europe, the project’s partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves in rugby and the Seattle Orcas in cricket extend visibility across U.S. sports markets, both of which are fast-growing hubs for digital assets. For most chains, mainstream sponsorships come years after launch. Solana leaned heavily on NFTs before moving into branding. Avalanche and Aptos focused on technical marketing. BlockDAG, however, is taking its shot at cultural recognition before listing, signaling ambition and intent to engage audiences beyond crypto insiders. Visibility in major sports is not just about exposure; it is about building trust. Mainstream audiences who might hesitate to engage with early projects recognize familiar names like Inter Milan. That connection can reduce barriers to participation, strengthening BlockDAG’s image as a credible project. This is particularly important because BlockDAG’s presale is primarily retail-driven. Unlike Aptos with $350M in VC funding or Avalanche with $230M raised from institutions, BlockDAG is pushing toward its $600M target with grassroots support. Sponsorships accelerate this retail-first model, pulling in non-crypto participants and reinforcing its identity as the “people’s blockchain.” Turning Visibility Into Participation Brand exposure alone is not enough, but BlockDAG has linked it to direct participation. Its X1 Mobile Miner app, downloaded by more than 2.5M users, which allows anyone to mine from their phone. Meanwhile, 19,500 units of its X10 hardware miners have been sold, creating an option for those seeking deeper involvement. Together, they form a pipeline: sports fans see the brand, curiosity drives downloads, and easy onboarding turns awareness into action. This two-track strategy, combining cultural visibility with simple entry points, explains why BlockDAG has reached adoption levels that other projects typically only achieve years after mainnet. Analysts See Strategic Value in Early Visibility From an analyst’s lens, BlockDAG’s sponsorships create more than brand buzz, they build strategic momentum. Ecosystem dominance often hinges on cultural recognition as much as technical strength. Ethereum became a leader not only because of smart contracts but because it captured cultural attention in DeFi and NFTs. Solana rose on the back of NFT hype and strong consumer mindshare. BlockDAG is moving on this front earlier than most. With EVM compatibility, 4,500+ developers, and more than 300 applications in progress, it is pairing technical credibility with global visibility. This dual approach, winning both developers and consumers, strengthens its position as it heads toward listing. For buyers, sponsorships reinforce presale confidence. At the Batch 30 price of $0.03 and a confirmed $0.05 listing, early participants are already looking at a clear 2,900% ROI pathway. Analyst predictions of $1 to $10 long-term valuations rely heavily on adoption, and mainstream visibility increases the odds by pulling in audiences beyond crypto-native communities. BlockDAG also stands out from competitors. Many presale projects launch with nothing more than a roadmap and an online group. BlockDAG, by contrast, enters the market with millions of fans already seeing its brand in stadiums and media, far outside traditional crypto circles. From Presale to Prime Time By partnering with Inter Milan and securing rugby and cricket sponsorships, BlockDAG is signaling an aggressive strategy: to debut not just as another blockchain, but as a global consumer brand from day one. Combined with $385M already raised, millions of mobile miners, and thousands of developers building, its presale success is being matched by cultural expansion. For a project still in presale, this level of mainstream exposure is highly unusual. Few ever reach stadiums, households, and media markets before they list. BlockDAG has managed it, and that early momentum could set the stage for one of the most anticipated Layer-1 launches of 2025.

      "url": "https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-on-edge-whale-moves-and-short-term-losses-signal-potential-shake-up/",
      "body": "Bitcoin continues to face challenges sustaining its momentum after retreating from its recent all-time high above $124,000. At the time of writing, the asset trades around $111,090, reflecting a 10.5% decline from its peak and a 4.2% drop over the past week. The pullback highlights growing uncertainty among traders as buying pressure weakens, even while some on-chain indicators suggest potential accumulation. One such signal comes from Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Analyst Crazzyblockk, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, examined a metric called the Binance Buying Power Ratio. According to the analyst, this ratio, measuring the inflow of stablecoins relative to Bitcoin outflows from Binance, has recently climbed sharply, moving into positive territory. The implication is that traders are sending stablecoins into the exchange (potential buying power) while withdrawing Bitcoin, likely for long-term storage. Related Reading: Bitcoin Keeps Slipping Down: Is $107,000 The Next Support? Binance Buying Power Ratio Signals Accumulation Crazzyblockk explained that this pattern points to a buildup of liquidity while simultaneously reducing the Bitcoin supply available for sale on Binance. In his words: Stablecoins in, BTC out. This combination of accumulating ‘dry powder’ and securing assets off-exchange is a classic sign of a market preparing for a bullish move. The surge in buying power ratio coincides with Bitcoin’s current consolidation phase, suggesting that some traders may be preparing for a rebound. Historically, an increase in stablecoin inflows has often preceded heightened trading activity, with many market participants using these reserves to enter positions once favorable conditions emerge. At the same time, large Bitcoin outflows from exchanges can reflect a broader trend of long-term holding behavior. Investors who transfer coins to private or institutional-grade wallets often intend to store them securely, limiting immediate selling pressure. If sustained, this dual trend of stablecoin accumulation and Bitcoin withdrawals could support the market by reducing available supply and preparing liquidity for upward moves. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Show Signs of Weakness While Binance metrics suggest optimism, another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, highlighted a more cautious indicator: the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for short-term holders (STHs). This metric measures whether coins moved on-chain are being sold at a profit or loss. Darkfost noted that the STH SOPR has now fallen below 1, with its monthly average sitting at the neutral point. In practical terms, this means that many recent buyers are no longer selling at a profit, and some are even taking losses. He wrote: Historically, when STH SOPR reaches this level, two scenarios are common. Either the market rebounds quickly, or short-term holders panic, leading to further losses. During this cycle, the second scenario has often played out—though these periods have consistently created opportunities for medium- to long-term investors. The comparison to late 2021, when Bitcoin last peaked at $69,000 before entering a prolonged correction, shows the weight of this signal. A persistent decline in SOPR could indicate rising pressure from traders seeking to exit, even as long-term holders demonstrate greater conviction.

      "url": "https://timestabloid.com/best-altcoins-to-buy-under-1-magacoin-finance-hedera/",
      "body": "The search for the best altcoins to buy under $1 has intensified as traders look for affordable coins with strong upside. With Bitcoin and Ethereum out of reach for many retail investors, attention has shifted to coins that still trade below the dollar yet show strong fundamentals and growing adoption. Analysts are closely watching Hedera, Dogecoin, and a fresh contender, MAGACOIN FINANCE . Backed by a HashEx audit, MAGACOIN is starting to make waves as one of the best altcoin to buy now for those seeking growth potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Secure Under-$1 Gem with 3800% Potential When discussing the best altcoins to buy under $1, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its blend of security and upside. The project has passed a full smart-contract audit from HashEx , a respected blockchain security firm known for rigorous testing. Passing all checks adds a layer of trust that investors usually demand from new projects. What’s drawing attention is MAGACOIN’s projected 3800% growth potential , fueled by rising adoption and its positioning as a secure choice in a volatile market. Analysts highlight that unlike meme-driven tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building from the ground up with strong fundamentals and a clear focus on sustainable growth. There’s also growing demand around its launch phase, with early buyers still able to claim a 50% bonus using the code PATRIOT50X . For many investors scanning through undervalued altcoins 2025, MAGACOIN is emerging as a name worth watching closely. Hedera: Strong Enterprise Use Cases Point to Big 2025 For those searching for the best crypto to buy now , Hedera (HBAR) has been making its case through real-world adoption. The project recently attracted attention with SWIFT’s blockchain payment trials scheduled for November 2025, a step that could see up to $150 trillion in annual settlements flow through Hedera’s hashgraph. That’s a scale few networks can match. Enterprise activity also continues to climb, with $126 million in stablecoins issued on Hedera, led by USDC’s overwhelming share. Analysts are growing more confident in Hedera’s ability to position itself as one of the top altcoins for 2025. Market watchers are already discussing the Hedera price prediction 2025 , with estimates pointing toward the $0.55 range. Source Crypto YouTuber Jesu Martinez even said he’s “50X more bullish on HBAR” after recent talks with the project’s founders, suggesting late 2025 and 2026 could be strong years for long-term holders. Dogecoin: Whale Moves and ETF Hype Keep It in Focus Another project topping analyst lists of the best altcoins to buy under $1 is Dogecoin (DOGE). The coin remains a trader favorite, boosted by whale activity and growing speculation around a potential spot DOGE ETF. Recent whale transfers of nearly 900 million DOGE (≈$200 million) to Binance spiked volatility, but on-chain data shows that whales quietly accumulated 680 million DOGE during the same period. DOGE analysis by Ali This kind of accumulation has analysts paying close attention. Influencer Ali suggested on X that “ Dogecoin $DOGE: One last dip before the breakout!”, while More Crypto Online noted that the $0.20 level is a critical support area for the token’s structure. Looking ahead, many are eyeing the Dogecoin price prediction 2025 with growing optimism. If ETF approvals come through—analysts assign a 60–70% chance within the next 12–18 months—Dogecoin could strengthen its place among the top altcoins for 2025 and maintain its status as a best altcoin to buy now for those betting on mainstream exposure. Final Word: Which Altcoin Stands Out? The race for the best altcoins to buy under $1 has intensified, with Hedera’s enterprise growth and Dogecoin’s ETF speculation fueling strong narratives. Both have bullish 2025 price predictions, making them attractive to traders and long-term investors. Yet, analysts are quick to point out that MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving a unique path. With an independent audit, rising adoption, and the chance for early supporters to grab a bonus, it’s gaining traction as the best crypto to buy now .

      "url": "https://timestabloid.com/blockdags-evm-compatibility-brings-4500-developers-onboard/",
      "body": "In crypto, developer traction often signals which networks will last. Ethereum’s lead comes from its large pool of builders, while other chains have struggled when they couldn’t attract enough projects. BlockDAG (BDAG) is already proving different. With full EVM compatibility and more than 4,500 developers building, it doesn’t need to start from zero. Instead, it offers an instant home for Ethereum-native applications. This zero-switching-cost model does more than simplify migration. It accelerates growth by giving builders the ability to bring their dApps directly into BlockDAG ’s system without rewriting code or learning a new framework. Since developer time is one of the scarcest resources in Web3, this path reduces friction and makes adoption far more likely. That advantage has already sparked visible momentum before the mainnet launch. Why EVM Compatibility Is a Game Changer The Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM, has become the standard for executing smart contracts. Networks like Polygon, Avalanche, and BNB Chain have grown quickly by supporting it, offering developers lower fees or faster speeds while keeping the same coding tools. By embracing EVM compatibility, BlockDAG gains access to Ethereum’s pool of builders and applications. For developers, the benefit is clear. They can port dApps into BlockDAG without costly redevelopment. For BlockDAG, this provides an immediate stream of projects across DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Analysts note this solves the cold start challenge that new blockchains face. Instead of waiting years to attract activity, BlockDAG is entering the field with usage already on the table. BlockDAG’s Developer Momentum Before Launch What makes BlockDAG stand out is that developer activity is already happening before the mainnet exists. Over 4,500 developers are engaged, with more than 300 dApps in progress across categories like finance, gaming, and NFTs. This level of traction is rare at the presale stage, showing BlockDAG is positioning itself as more than a fundraiser. Its presale performance reinforces that story. The project has raised over $385 million and sold more than 25.5 billion coins across 30 batches. Early buyers from batch one are already sitting on paper gains of 2,900%, with the coin now priced at $0.03. Miner sales have also passed $7.8 million, with over 19,400 miners sold worldwide. With a hard cap of $600M, BlockDAG is already set up with resources for listings and ecosystem expansion. The combination of developer adoption and presale momentum creates a strong foundation. Developers benefit from frictionless migration through EVM compatibility, while the presale provides the liquidity needed for growth. Analysts note that this dual-track strategy, technical adoption plus financial support, separates BlockDAG from other presales that rely solely on hype. This is why BlockDAG’s projections of hitting $1 by 2027, $5 by 2030, and even $10 in bullish cases feel more achievable. Developer traction ensures that demand is built on real-world usage rather than only speculation. Why Developers Choose BlockDAG BlockDAG’s architecture blends DAG scalability with Proof of Work security. Ethereum’s congestion and gas costs have long frustrated developers, but BlockDAG’s setup offers faster confirmations with parallel processing. Testnet results already show 10 blocks per second, with scalability expected to improve as adoption grows. For dApps that need speed and reliability, such as exchanges, lending apps, and gaming platforms, this is an attractive option. Builders get Ethereum-level programmability with Bitcoin-like security, giving them fewer trade-offs. The 300+ projects in progress across DeFi, gaming, and NFTs highlight the momentum. Analysts often say ecosystems grow in clusters, and once a few flagship projects move, more follow. With EVM compatibility lowering migration costs, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a natural option for Ethereum-based projects looking for scale. Building the Ecosystem on Familiar Ground BlockDAG’s decision to fully support EVM means it connects with the most widely used standard in Web3. It doesn’t reinvent development from scratch. Instead, it gives builders a smoother path and better tools. That’s why thousands of developers are already engaged before launch. Alongside its developer traction, cultural visibility is also growing. Sponsorships with Inter Milan and U.S. sports teams add mainstream exposure, while the builder community drives technical adoption. This balance of public visibility and developer depth helps seed the project from both ends. With batch 30 priced at $0.03 and a $0.05 listing confirmed, the presale ROI has already reached 2,900%. Long-term analyst targets of $1 to $10 depend on adoption, and developer activity makes those projections realistic. BlockDAG isn’t starting from zero, it’s starting with momentum.

      "title": "Tezos price prediction 2025-2031: How high can XTZ rise?",
      "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tezos-price-prediction/",
      "body": "Key takeaways: Tezos price prediction suggests a recovery to $1.42 by the end of 2025. XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.7914 Market cap $834.88M Trading volume (24-hour) $18.08M Circulating supply 1.056B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.8023 24-hour low $0.784 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.87% 50-day SMA $0.8096 14-Day RSI 47.42 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 51 (Neutral) Green days 13/30 (43%) 200-day SMA $0.6568 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: XTZ is trapped in $0.76-$0.83 consolidation zone with decreasing volume. The MACD is near zero with minimal directional bias. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart XTZ’s daily chart as of August 28, 2025 shows a modest 0.52% gain that fails to address the underlying bearish structure. The price remains trapped below the middle Bollinger Band at $0.8340 and well beneath the upper band resistance at $0.9044, indicating sustained selling pressure since the July highs. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD hovers near the zero line with minimal momentum in either direction, while the histogram shows slight compression, suggesting potential for a directional move but lacking clear conviction. The token appears stuck in a grinding sideways pattern between $0.76-$0.83, with neither bulls nor bears able to establish decisive control. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart confirms XTZ’s technical difficulties with the token struggling to break above the descending trendline resistance that has capped rallies since late July around $0.84. Current price action at $0.7919 shows the token consolidating just below the 21-period SMA at $0.7981, which now acts as immediate resistance after previously serving as support. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView Volume patterns reveal diminishing interest with 24-hour volume at just 1.59M, significantly lower than the 4M+ levels seen during more active periods, suggesting retail and institutional participation has waned considerably. The On-Balance Volume at 347.95M shows relatively stable accumulation patterns, indicating that while selling pressure exists, there’s no panic distribution occurring. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.7402 BUY SMA 5 $0.8041 SELL SMA 10 $0.8094 SELL SMA 21 $0.8373 SELL SMA 50 $0.8096 SELL SMA 100 $0.6973 BUY SMA 200 $0.6568 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.8145 SELL EMA 5 $0.7833 BUY EMA 10 $0.7238 BUY EMA 21 $0.6827 BUY EMA 50 $0.7112 BUY EMA 100 $0.8038 SELL EMA 200 $0.8757 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? XTZ looks positioned for a decisive breakout from its current consolidation range, though direction remains uncertain. A break above $0.83 with volume would target the $0.87-$0.90 resistance zone, while failure to hold $0.76 support could lead to a test of the lower $0.72-$0.74 area, where stronger buying interest might emerge. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Recent news/opinion on Tezos Tezos unveiled Teslink, a modular interoperability layer connecting Tezos with EVM-compatible chains like Ethlink. ICYMI: The latest Tezos X-Plained dives into Tezlink and how it can unlock new ways to build on Tezos. But what exactly is Tezlink, and why does it matter? 🤔 ⬇️ https://t.co/HwD4vPu6ea pic.twitter.com/U2w11aZGAf — Tezos (@tezos) August 2, 2025 Tezos price prediction August 2025 If the bulls back XTZ, the token could break out, reaching a peak of $0.94 while maintaining an average trading price of $0.78 in August 2025.

For that to happen, future price movements and an increase in Tezos’ adoption must be bullish. Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coingecko Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it lost momentum, averaging $0.72 per unit. After a failed attempt at breaking above $0.80 in early March, XTZ managed a high of $0.6186 in April and $0.70 in May. XTZ maintained a trading range of $0.4752 and $0.6362 in June; in July, it maintained an average price of $0.7232. XTZ kicked off August at $0.7605 and is currently trading around $0.79.",

Bitwise’s BITB experienced a slight outflow of $3.05 million, a common occurrence in a dynamic market where investors rebalance portfolios. What Do These Spot ETF Inflows Signify for the Crypto Market? These significant Spot ETF inflows on August 27 are more than just numbers; they tell a compelling story about the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency. Firstly, they demonstrate increasing institutional confidence. Large asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity are not just participating; they are actively driving substantial capital into these products. Investor Confidence: The consecutive days of inflows suggest a growing belief in the long-term viability and potential of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Market Maturity: The availability and adoption of spot ETFs make crypto assets more accessible to a broader range of investors, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset world. Liquidity and Stability: Consistent inflows can contribute to increased market liquidity and potentially reduce volatility, making the crypto market more appealing to risk-averse investors. This trend suggests that crypto assets are increasingly viewed as legitimate components of a diversified investment portfolio, moving beyond their speculative origins. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for Spot ETF Inflows? Looking ahead, the sustained positive trend in Spot ETF inflows could have profound implications. Investors should closely monitor these flows as a key indicator of market sentiment and institutional adoption. As more financial advisors and platforms integrate these products, we might see even greater capital allocation. Potential for Growth: Continued strong performance could encourage more traditional investors to allocate a portion of their portfolios to crypto via ETFs. Regulatory Landscape: While the current inflows are positive, future regulatory developments will play a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of these funds. Clarity and favorable policies could further accelerate adoption. Diversification Benefits: For many, these ETFs offer a regulated and convenient way to gain exposure to crypto without directly holding the underlying assets, simplifying portfolio management. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone keen on the future of digital asset investing. The robust Spot ETF inflows witnessed on August 27 for both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs mark a pivotal moment.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs? Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold the underlying cryptocurrency, Bitcoin or Ethereum, respectively. This allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of these digital assets without needing to buy and store the cryptocurrencies themselves. Q2: Why are these net inflows significant? These significant net inflows indicate growing institutional and retail investor confidence in the long-term value and legitimacy of Bitcoin and Ethereum. They also represent increasing market maturity and the integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems. Q3: Which firms saw the largest inflows on August 27? On August 27, BlackRock’s ETHA led with $270 million in Ethereum ETF inflows, while BlackRock’s IBIT recorded the largest Bitcoin ETF inflow at $50.73 million. Q4: Did all spot crypto ETFs experience inflows? No, while most funds saw positive inflows, Bitwise’s BITB, a spot Bitcoin ETF, experienced a slight outflow of $3.05 million on August 27. Q5: How do spot ETFs differ from futures ETFs? Spot ETFs directly hold the actual cryptocurrency, reflecting its current market price. Futures ETFs, on the other hand, invest in futures contracts that bet on the future price of the cryptocurrency, rather than holding the asset itself. Did you find this analysis insightful?

      "body": "John Deaton, a well-respected attorney and former U.S. Senate candidate, recently acknowledged the global scale of XRP adoption, emphasizing its institutional growth and strong retail base. His remarks followed a post by ETF specialist Nate Geraci, who noted that CME Group’s XRP futures contracts have surpassed $1 billion in open interest, the fastest contract ever to reach that milestone, achieving it within three months. Geraci also highlighted the $800 million already tied up in futures-based XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Deaton responded by stressing the significance of XRP’s user base and its impact on related markets. He stated, “I predicted this just like I predicted Gemini’s XRP Card would be Gemini’s most popular credit card,” referencing Gemini’s recently launched XRP rewards card backed by Mastercard and issued by WebBank. Deaton added that he believes XRP holders helped drive Gemini’s mobile application to surpass Coinbase’s app in recent download figures. I predicted this just like I predicted @Gemini ’s XRP Card would be Gemini’s most popular credit card. In fact, I think XRP holders made the Gemini App surpass Coinbase app regarding recent downloads. Remember, 75K XRP Holders, from 143 Countries around the world, joined as amici… https://t.co/EqVPaGOznB — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) August 26, 2025 The Important Role of the XRP Army Highlighting the active participation of XRP investors, Deaton recalled the 75,000 XRP holders he helped represent, who were from 143 countries. He stressed that such collective legal involvement was unprecedented in the crypto industry. Other experts have emphasized the role of the community, noting that XRP may not have succeeded the way it did without its passionate community . For Deaton, the involvement of this global community is a direct indicator of sustained retail demand that complements growing institutional interest. The combination of CME futures activity, ETF inflows, and consumer-facing products like the Gemini XRP credit card suggests that demand is not confined to one area of the market. While futures growth demonstrates rising interest from institutional traders, retail adoption continues to expand rapidly. Anticipation for Spot XRP ETFs The next development attracting attention is the pending lineup of spot XRP ETF applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Several proposals are awaiting responses by October , with expectations among analysts and investors leaning toward eventual approval. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In Canada, where spot XRP ETFs have already been introduced, trading volumes have broken records , reinforcing the notion that similar products in the U.S. could see substantial uptake. The approval of such funds would provide regulated exposure to XRP, potentially broadening access for both institutional and retail investors. Taken together, the rising demand across derivatives, ETFs, consumer products, and community engagement shows the rising demand for XRP. Deaton’s remarks emphasize that both grassroots and institutional participation are reinforcing one another, contributing to a broader ecosystem of demand that could translate to substantial price growth in the short and long term.

      "url": "https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sharplink-gaming-ethereum-investment-4/",
      "body": "BitcoinWorld Sharplink Gaming’s Bold Move: A Massive $23.5M Ethereum Investment Ahead? The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with news about a significant move by a publicly traded company. Sharplink Gaming Ethereum strategy is once again in the spotlight as the Nasdaq-listed firm (Nasdaq: SBET), a known strategic investor in Ethereum, has reportedly transferred a substantial 23.46 million USDT to Galaxy Digital. This transfer, highlighted by on-chain analysis firm Lookonchain, strongly suggests that Sharplink Gaming might be gearing up for an additional, massive purchase of ETH. This development is certainly worth watching for anyone interested in institutional crypto adoption and its impact on the market. What is Driving Sharplink Gaming’s Ethereum Ambition? Sharplink Gaming (SBET) is not new to the Ethereum space. They have previously demonstrated a clear interest in the asset, positioning themselves as a strategic investor. This latest transfer of 23.46 million USDT, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, indicates a calculated move rather than a speculative gamble. Galaxy Digital, a prominent financial services and investment management company specializing in digital assets, is the recipient of these funds. This partnership underscores the professional and institutional nature of the transaction, providing a secure channel for large-scale crypto operations. The decision to potentially increase their Sharplink Gaming Ethereum holdings aligns with a broader trend of corporations diversifying their treasuries and seeking exposure to high-growth digital assets. Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem, smart contract capabilities, and upcoming scalability improvements, remains a top choice for institutional players looking for long-term value. Moreover, the transparency of on-chain data, as provided by Lookonchain, allows us to observe these significant movements in real-time, offering valuable insights into institutional strategies. How Might This Sharplink Gaming Ethereum Purchase Impact the Market? A purchase of this magnitude by a publicly traded company like Sharplink Gaming could have several implications for the Ethereum market. While 23.46 million USDT is a considerable sum, its immediate impact on ETH price might be limited given Ethereum’s large market capitalization and daily trading volumes. However, the psychological impact could be significant. Key Potential Impacts: Increased Institutional Confidence: This move signals continued confidence from traditional companies in Ethereum’s long-term potential, potentially encouraging other corporate entities to follow suit. Market Sentiment Boost: Positive news about institutional adoption often acts as a catalyst for broader market optimism, attracting both retail and institutional investors. Demand for ETH: A direct purchase of ETH by Sharplink Gaming would contribute to the overall demand, especially if executed in a structured manner through a firm like Galaxy Digital. Furthermore, Sharplink Gaming’s strategic approach to Sharplink Gaming Ethereum investments highlights the growing sophistication of corporate treasury management in the digital age. They are not just buying crypto; they are engaging with established financial intermediaries to execute their vision with precision. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of Sharplink Gaming’s Ethereum Investment? Investing heavily in a volatile asset like Ethereum comes with both opportunities and risks. For Sharplink Gaming, the potential benefits include: Capital Appreciation: If Ethereum’s value continues to grow, their investment could see substantial returns, boosting company assets and shareholder value. Portfolio Diversification: Adding digital assets to their portfolio provides diversification away from traditional asset classes, potentially reducing overall risk. Innovation Alignment: Aligning with cutting-edge technology like Ethereum can enhance a company’s image as forward-thinking and innovative in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. However, challenges are also present: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate wildly, exposing the investment to significant risk and potential losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing potential compliance challenges for corporate holders. Public Scrutiny: As a Nasdaq-listed company, Sharplink Gaming faces public and shareholder scrutiny over its investment decisions, requiring clear communication. Therefore, any move by Sharplink Gaming Ethereum strategy must be carefully considered, balancing potential rewards against inherent risks. Their choice of Galaxy Digital as a partner suggests a professional approach to mitigating some of these challenges and ensuring a secure transaction. In conclusion, Sharplink Gaming’s transfer of 23.46 million USDT to Galaxy Digital for a potential Ethereum purchase is a compelling indicator of ongoing institutional interest in the crypto market. This strategic decision by a Nasdaq-listed entity not only reinforces Ethereum’s position as a preferred institutional asset but also provides a fascinating case study in corporate crypto adoption.

      "body": "Since its launch, Ethereum has generated over 14,000% ROI, making it one of the most successful cryptocurrencies. Many early investors are looking to grab a much bigger share of the market. In 2025, Ethereum remains at the center of institutional adoption interest, but smart money conversations now turn to where the next big breakout is likely to occur. According to analysts, as Ethereum has confirmed its dominance in the industry, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a strong opportunity for long-term upside. Ethereum: Network Activity Surges Amid Institutional Growth Ethereum’s price recently spiked past $4,800, almost reaching new multiyear highs. However, the basics of the network seem to be unrivaled wholesomely. Transactions rose by 63% in the last 30 days while that of the active addresses climbed 26%. In the last 48 hours, exchanges have had over 200,000 ETH withdrawn, creating the potential for a supply squeeze. Staking demand is picking up so heavily that over 870,000 ETH worth more than $4.16 billion remain in the exit queue on Ethereum PoS. Confidence in the industry continues to increase as treasury giant Bitmine purchases an additional 9,613 ETH worth about 45 million. Despite $388 million in liquidations from leveraged longs, traders are rotating Bitcoin to Ethereum, which shows it’s bullish, analysts say. Ethereum’s 14,000% return on investment continues to be a testament to the rewards of early adoption of the right project. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Next Smart Money Play Ethereum’s historical 14,000% return on investment (“ROI”) is creating a new wave of hype around MAGACOIN FINANCE. The unique ecosystem has been audited double time by both HashEx and CertiK. It has received a safe, secure and fully transparent stamp passing all tests. With whale-backed inflows, a KYC-verified team and predictions of a major upside, analysts have called it one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 . Early buyers using PATRIOT50X receive a 50% EXTRA presale bonus, but allocations are running out fast. Unlike speculative presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE is layered on credibility. Two of the most reputable blockchain security companies audited it twice, giving assurance about its technical safety. While Ethereum made early investors rich, MAGACOIN FINANCE now offers the asymmetric opportunity that could deliver similar upside in the current cycle. Why Smart Money Is Paying Attention Institutions or whales usually put their money into safer growth opportunities. Ethereum is still a contender, but is so large now that smaller, vetted projects can offer much better multiples. MAGACOIN FINANCE is being referred to by analysts and smart money forums as a project that combines safety with urgency due to scarcity. As presale allocations become tighter and added perks like PATRIOT50X drive more inflows, the early window to make huge returns is closing fast. Conclusion Ethereum’s historic 14,000% ROI is proof of how transformative early investment in the right project can be. In 2025, Ethereum remains a pillar of the crypto ecosystem, but analysts agree that the most exciting new growth story lies in presales. With its double audits, whale-backed demand, and KYC-verified team, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being recognized as one of the best cryptos to buy in 2025 — offering smart money investors the chance to capture exponential upside before allocations disappear.

      "body": "BitcoinWorld Memecoin Scam Unveiled: South Korea Police Arrest Three in Shocking $4.1M Fraud The cryptocurrency world, while exciting and innovative, unfortunately also attracts nefarious actors. A recent and alarming development from South Korea highlights this reality, as authorities have cracked down on a significant memecoin scam . This incident serves as a stark reminder for all investors to exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough research before committing funds to any digital asset, especially those promising extravagant returns. How Did This Memecoin Scam Unfold? Police in South Korea’s Gyeonggi Nambu Province recently announced the arrest and referral for prosecution of three individuals. These arrests are linked to an alleged crypto fraud that successfully defrauded 129 victims, amounting to approximately 5.7 billion won, or about $4.1 million. This was not a small operation; it was a carefully orchestrated scheme. The Project: The group created a fraudulent memecoin called GCV. Timeline: This scheme operated between December 2023 and June 2024. The Lure: Scammers enticed investors with false promises of an exclusive Asian golf course membership. This membership was supposedly in exchange for investing in their GCV coin. The Impact: Many individuals lost significant amounts of money, believing they were securing a valuable asset and a luxurious perk. The ringleader, identified only as A, along with two accomplices, now faces legal action for their role in this extensive memecoin scam . Understanding the Allure of Crypto Fraud and Golf Memberships Why do such scams, particularly those involving luxury promises, continue to ensnare investors? The appeal often lies in a blend of aspirational living and the perceived ‘get rich quick’ nature of some crypto projects. Investors, drawn by the promise of high returns and exclusive benefits like golf memberships, might overlook critical red flags. Moreover, the novelty of memecoins can sometimes make it harder for new investors to distinguish legitimate projects from outright fraud. Scammers exploit this lack of familiarity, creating elaborate narratives that sound plausible to the untrained ear. They often leverage social media and community hype to build a false sense of legitimacy, making it challenging to identify a memecoin scam early on. Protecting Yourself from a Memecoin Scam: Actionable Insights Staying safe in the crypto space requires vigilance. Here are some key strategies to protect your investments and avoid falling victim to a memecoin scam : Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always investigate the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, and community. Look for transparency and a clear roadmap. Be Wary of Unrealistic Promises: If an investment promises guaranteed high returns or exclusive real-world assets (like golf memberships) for a new, unproven coin, it’s a major red flag. Check for Audits: Legitimate crypto projects often undergo smart contract audits by reputable third-party firms. Verify Team Identity: Anonymous teams can be a warning sign. While some legitimate projects start anonymously, transparency often increases trust. Community Scrutiny: Engage with the project’s community, but be critical. Scammers can create fake engagement. Start Small: If you’re unsure, invest only what you can afford to lose. Remember, a healthy skepticism is your best defense against sophisticated fraudsters. The Broader Impact of Crypto Fraud in South Korea This incident in South Korea underscores the ongoing challenges faced by regulators and law enforcement in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Crypto fraud not only harms individual investors but also erodes trust in the broader digital asset market. Governments globally are working to establish clearer regulations to protect consumers, however, the pace of innovation often outstrips legislative efforts. The arrests send a strong message that authorities are taking these crimes seriously. It highlights the importance of international cooperation in tracking down perpetrators and recovering stolen assets, as crypto transactions often cross borders. Addressing the challenges posed by a memecoin scam requires a multi-faceted approach, combining robust security measures, investor education, and effective law enforcement. Conclusion: Staying Vigilant Against Memecoin Scams The South Korean authorities’ swift action against this $4.1 million memecoin scam offers a glimmer of hope for justice. However, it also serves as a crucial reminder for every crypto enthusiast: the responsibility to protect your investments ultimately rests with you. By understanding the common tactics of scammers, exercising caution, and performing diligent research, you can significantly reduce your risk of becoming another victim of crypto fraud. Stay informed, stay critical, and invest wisely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What happened in the South Korea memecoin scam?

      "body": "Bitcoin price is showing bearish signs below $113,000. BTC is struggling to recover and might start another decline below the $110,500 zone. Bitcoin started a recovery wave from the $108,750 zone. The price is trading below $112,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $111,350 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $113,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Attempts Fresh Increase Bitcoin price extended losses after close below the $112,000 level.

Any more gains might send the price toward the $115,500 level. The main target could be $116,500. Another Decline In BTC?

      "title": "Circle taps Mastercard and Finastra to push USDC into global payments",
      "url": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/circle-taps-mastercard-and-finastra/",
      "body": "Circle, the company behind USD Coin (USDC), is pushing to make stablecoins a mainstream tool in traditional banking. The firm is announcing new partnerships with Mastercard and Finastra to integrate USDC into payment flows for merchants and banks worldwide. These partnerships represent one of the most aggressive efforts yet to expand the use of stablecoins in everyday financial services . They arrive when regulators and banks are increasingly interested in how digital currencies can speed up settlement and reduce costs. Mastercard announced that acquirers and merchants in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) will now be able to settle transactions in USDC and Euro Coin (EURC). It is the first time that settlement with stablecoins will be available on Mastercard’s regional network. Arab Financial Services and Eazy Financial Services will initially launch the service. For merchants, this means payment can be cleared and settled faster and more efficiently than with conventional systems, many of which rely on intermediaries and protracted clearing cycles. The service will help companies reduce friction and smooth liquidity, Mastercard said. Stablecoins can drive down the time and cost —and frankly make it easier — for international settlements and merchants to receive money in an environment where they never go to their correspondent bank. Mastercard demonstrates confidence in digital assets as an adjunct to current payment rails by piloting stablecoin settlement in emerging markets. If it works, the model could spread to other areas. Finastra brings USDC to cross-border payments. Finastra, one of the largest financial software firms in the world, has added support for USDC to its Global PAYplus payment solution. This platform is of such wide use among banks that it handles over $5 trillion in cross-border transactions daily. The integration also means that banks in at least 50 countries can settle payments in USDC even if the payment instructions are written in a legacy fiat currency, such as the dollar, euro, or British pound. For the banks here, this is a big blow. They can use Circle’s blockchain-based settlement solution without changing their infrastructure. The plug-in solution enables them to provide quicker and more cost-effective international payments and keep up with the financial industry standards. Finastra said the partnership offers a way for banks to innovate in cross-border payments, at scale. It also makes stablecoin use cases more feasible by plugging directly into legacy bank rails. Circle drives global adoption of USDC Circle’s activities with Mastercard and Finastra are part of a broader wave of efforts to grow USDC adoption worldwide. The development comes after the July passage of the GENIUS Act, which sets a federal framework for stablecoins in the U.S., the first of its kind in the country, and Circle’s accelerating tie-ups with key financial players. Circle teamed up with crypto exchange OKX in July to allow zero-fee USDC conversions into U.S. dollars. This pumped up USDC liquidity in Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. South Korea’s top banks, KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Hana, and Woori, are reportedly preparing to meet with Circle to explore a potential partnership in the stablecoin market. The meeting, scheduled during Tarbert’s visit to Seoul this month, is part of South Korean banks’ push to enter the stablecoin sector as the country moves toward establishing a regulatory framework for digital assets. As reported by Cryptopolitan earlier last week, major commercial banks in South Korea are ramping up preparations for stablecoin issuance ahead of upcoming legislation to shape the sector. Sources indicate that discussions have focused on potential collaborations with domestic fintech and tech giants as well as with international issuers of dollar-backed stablecoins, such as Circle. Circle also teamed up with SBI Group, Ripple, and Startale in Japan to further USDC uptake and create a tokenized asset platform for real-world assets. Together, these moves suggest a clear strategy: Embed USDC into the world’s financial arteries, from merchant settlements to cross-border banking.

Coinbase Listing Claims Surface According to posts on X, a 2021 Pi Network Hackathon winner called Pi Barter Mall suggested a Coinbase listing could be in the offing. The comment touched off fresh debate among users who have been watching for the Pi coin to reach major global exchanges. Coinbase’s CLO, Paul Grewal, posted a Pi Day image back in March that showed purple pies with the Pi logo. It was not a formal announcement. But it did rekindle rumors and talk across social channels.

Access to PiOS has been used to run new hackathons. One such event aims to get apps working with Pi in everyday transactions. Community moderators have suggested the open-source move could arrive before the end of the year, though the Pi Core Team has not confirmed specific dates. Questions that have long lingered about code transparency are expected to be addressed once more of the code is public. Binance And Swapfone Developments Screenshots have circulated showing Binance Connect and Binance P2P support options appearing inside the Pi Wallet’s Help & Support menu. That detail prompted discussion about a potential Binance integration, but users also pointed to hurdles that have slowed any listing. A lack of clear utility and concerns over decentralization were cited as reasons for delays. Meanwhile, practical steps have been taken elsewhere: Pi Coin secured a listing on Swapfone, a US-regulated, mobile-focused exchange, which launched a PI/USDS trading pair in July. Small Steps Toward Broader Exposure The Swapfone listing was described by some community members as Pi’s first meaningful move into the US trading scene. It is small in scale when compared with top global exchanges, but it is a footprint on American rails.

      "body": "The final quarter of 2025 is already shaping up to be one of the most exciting in recent memory for crypto investors. Presales are back in the spotlight, and analysts are pointing to a select few projects as the top crypto presales worth watching. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a breakout star, with its presale raising more than $13 million . Often compared to the early stages of legendary projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing strong attention as one of the best crypto presale opportunities of the year. Alongside it, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has crossed $11.2 million in presale funding with its ambitious Bitcoin layer-two solution, while TOKEN6900 (T6900) is making waves as a viral meme coin raising over $2.3 million . Together, these three projects are dominating discussions around the top crypto presales to watch this quarter. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale: A Standout Performer Smart investors are calling MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the top crypto presales in Q4 2025 , thanks to its rapid fundraising momentum and strong grassroots appeal. Early-stage investors have already committed over $13 million , demonstrating confidence in the project’s ability to replicate the early success of past meme coin giants. MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly built a reputation as a safe and reliable project. It recently passed an independent smart contract audit by HashEx, giving investors added confidence that the code is secure and free from major risks. Beyond the audit, the team has been open about its plans, sharing a clear roadmap that outlines every stage of development. This level of transparency, combined with strong community backing, makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out as a trustworthy presale in today’s market. Analysts also note that whale wallets have started accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE tokens quietly — a signal often seen before explosive breakouts. With retail hype growing and presale allocations filling fast, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now widely ranked as a best crypto presale to watch this quarter. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A DeFi-Ready Layer 2 for Bitcoin Another project grabbing attention among the top crypto presales is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) , which has already raised over $11.2 million in its presale. Unlike traditional meme coins, Bitcoin Hyper is building a layer-two (L2) scaling solution for Bitcoin , designed to fix slow speeds and high fees. Key highlights for HYPER include: Integration with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM): Brings high throughput and scalability to Bitcoin. Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Bundles transactions and settles them securely on Bitcoin’s base layer. Utility Features: Staking, governance, and dApp deployment are all planned. High APY Potential: Token holders can earn up to 98% APY from staking rewards. With Bitcoin continuing its long-term upward trajectory, HYPER offers a unique value proposition as both a utility token and an investment play. Many analysts believe this makes Bitcoin Hyper one of the best crypto presale opportunities for long-term growth. TOKEN6900 (T6900): Meme Coin Madness with Marketing Power If you’re looking for pure meme-driven energy, TOKEN6900 (T6900) is quickly earning a reputation as one of the top crypto presales this year. Branding itself as the “New Global Benchmark for Brain Rot Finance,” T6900 has already raised $2.3 million in its presale. What sets TOKEN6900 apart is its unapologetic focus on marketing: 40% of Presale Funds for Marketing: Ensuring high visibility and viral campaigns. Inspired by SPX6900: A meme token that delivered nearly 100,000% returns. Total Supply Joke: Set at 930,993,091 — exactly one token more than SPX’s supply. Staking Rewards: Token holders can earn up to 33% APY , with 139 million tokens already staked. Analysts believe T6900 could easily be 10x due to its community-driven hype and aggressive marketing tactics. While speculative, its potential makes it a best crypto presale for high-risk, high-reward investors. Final Thoughts: Best Crypto Presales in Q4 2025 The fourth quarter of 2025 is definitely filled with opportunities that exceed expectations, but there are three projects that are distinctly rising above the rest to become the best crypto presales. MAGACOIN FINANCE — A viral meme coin presale already past $13M. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) — A DeFi-ready Bitcoin L2 solution with $11.2M raised. TOKEN6900 (T6900) — A chaotic, meme-fueled project with bold marketing power. For investors seeking the best crypto presale opportunities this quarter, these three projects offer very different strengths — from meme-fueled hype to groundbreaking utility. With MAGACOIN FINANCE leading the charge past $13M, the retail buzz is undeniable.

      "url": "https://bitcoinist.com/irans-crypto-sector-suffers-11-decline-following-90-m-exchange-hack/",
      "body": "According to reports, Iran’s on-chain crypto activity fell sharply in the first half of 2025. Inflows totaled $3.7 billion in the first seven months, a 10% drop from the same period in 2024. The slump accelerated after April: June flows contracted 50% year-on-year and July tumbled 75%. Major Exchange Breach Shakes Trust Based on a TRM Labs report , a major security breach hit Nobitex on June 18. Roughly $90 million was taken from hot wallets, source code was leaked, and some stolen coins were steered to vanity addresses that referenced the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Outflows from the exchange spiked — more than 150% in the week before the fighting — as traders moved funds to what they saw as safer places. Trust, already fragile, was seriously damaged. Inbound Transactions Collapse As Users Withdraw Nobitex’s inbound transfers dropped by about 70% year-on-year after the breach. Some dormant Bitcoin wallets tied to mining activity were activated and later routed funds into a newly created hot wallet. Regulators responded by imposing overnight trading curbs designed to slow panic, but many users had already pulled funds offshore. Reports show a surge in transfers to foreign platforms and payment processors that have lighter identity checks. Stablecoin Freezes Strain Liquidity In July, Tether froze 42 wallets linked to Iran, removing a large chunk of usable stablecoin liquidity on local rails. More than half of those wallets had ties, on-chain, to Nobitex or addresses flagged with IRGC links, though ownership remains unclear. Tether also froze $27 million in USDT tied to Garantex , a sanctioned Russian exchange, an action that highlights the broad reach of compliance moves. The US Treasury blacklisted Garantex in 2022, and that prior action has had echoing effects on market behavior. Power Cuts And Conflict Worsen Market Stress The decline in flows came during a period of heightened regional tension. A 12-day conflict with Israel erupted in mid-June while nuclear talks stalled. Israeli strikes and internal disruptions led to widespread electricity outages. Mining rigs were idled. Trading became harder. For many traders, the safest option was to move funds off domestic rails; for others it was to switch stablecoins or chains. New Taxes Tighten The Grip In August, Iran approved the Law on Taxation of Speculation and Profiteering. The law brings capital gains taxes to crypto, gold, real estate, and forex. Enforcement will roll out in stages, but officials say oversight will increase. That policy move, combined with freezes and hacks, gives firms more reason to pause or shift operations.
