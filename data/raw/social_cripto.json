    "content": "Morgan Stanley, one of the world’s largest investment banks, plans to introduce crypto trading on its consumer platform in the latest move by a traditional financial institution to capitalize on President Donald Trump’s deregulation of the crypto industry.\n\nThe banking giant plans to allow its customers to buy and sell crypto on its subsidiary, E*Trade, starting sometime next year, according to a Bloomberg report, citing “people familiar with the matter.” In order to establish and maintain the complex mechanisms needed to trade crypto, the company is reportedly considering partnering with one or more established crypto firms, according to the report.\n\nMorgan Stanley declined to comment when contacted by Fortune. E*Trade did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fortune.\n\nE*Trade, acquired by Morgan Stanley in 2020 for $13 billion, is a trading platform that offers stocks, options, and other assets. It currently has more than 5 million users who have access to Bitcoin and Ethereum in the form of exchange-traded funds—assets traded on the stock market that track the price of the cryptocurrencies—but cannot directly invest in the digital assets.\n\nIf Morgan Stanley makes good on its reported crypto ambitions, it would be entering a crowded field, facing competition from popular crypto trading platforms like Robinhood and Coinbase.\n\nReported interest from Morgan Stanley in becoming more involved in crypto trading comes on the heels of a Federal Reserve announcement last week that it was rescinding guidance from 2022 and 2023 that urged banks to exercise caution when dealing with cryptocurrencies and related activities. In the same breath, the Fed said that it would “consider whether additional guidance to support innovation, including crypto-asset activities, is appropriate.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made his pro-crypto stance clear, promising to make America “the crypto capital of the world.” Within his first 100 days in office, the president has reversed many of the crypto-related enforcement actions that took place under the Biden administration, established a national Bitcoin reserve, and supported the development of a regulatory framework for the industry.\n\nSeveral traditional finance companies have already taken advantage of the shifting regulatory landscape in the U.S. Fidelity Investments announced that it had begun testing its own stablecoin in March. Additionally, in February Bank of America’s CEO Brian Moynihan expressed interest in entering the stablecoin market once a regulatory framework is passed by lawmakers.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "description": null,
    "content": "The Trump family’s latest venture into crypto raises eyebrows, with an alleged $750 million deal placing Trump-backed entities on both sides of a transaction.\n\nNow, all eyes turn to the trading debut of WLFI, a governance token tied to World Liberty Financial, the family’s flagship crypto vehicle.\n\nWLFI’s Launch Could Redefine the Trump Family Fortune\n\nAccording to reports by the Wall Street Journal, World Liberty Financial (WLF) orchestrated a takeover of payments firm Alt5 Sigma.\n\nSponsored Sponsored\n\nSoon after, Alt5 raised $750 million from outside investors and used that capital to buy WLFI tokens directly from World Liberty.\n\nThe arrangement could hand the Trumps an estimated $500 million payday since an entity tied to the family controls up to three-quarters of revenues from token sales.\n\nSuch “circular transactions,” where the same group appears as both buyer and seller, are relatively common in crypto but rare in traditional finance (TradFi).\n\nFormer regulators warn they blur lines of transparency and risk conflicts of interest.\n\n“This structure brings the worst practices of the crypto ecosystem into regulated public markets,” the TradFi media reported, citing Corey Frayer, a former senior SEC official.\n\nStill, provided disclosures are complete, lawyers note the deal likely complies with US securities law.\n\nSponsored Sponsored\n\nThe unusual structure reflects how crypto quickly became the Trump family’s dominant business interest. It has overshadowed the real estate empire Donald Trump built over five decades.\n\nMeanwhile, this report comes barely a week after Alt5 Sigma raised $1.5 billion through stock offerings to fund its crypto treasury strategy focused on WLFI tokens.\n\nThe payments firm also faces an SEC investigation, focusing on potential fraud, including earnings inflation and stock manipulation.\n\nBillions on Paper, But What Next?\n\nThe high-stakes maneuver comes as WLFI prepares to begin trading on September 1, coinciding with Labor Day, while US markets are closed.\n\nSponsored Sponsored\n\nEarly market chatter values WLFI at around 30 cents a token, giving it a potential market cap that could rival that of the top 45 digital assets.\n\nSome investors are betting it climbs higher, perhaps vaulting into the top 20, which could attract listings on more exchanges. Trading platforms already in the lineup to list WLFI include Kraken, the OKX exchange, Justin Sun’s HTX, MEXC, Gate.io, and KuCoin.\n\nOn paper, the Trump family’s WLFI holdings exceed $6 billion, with President Trump himself holding roughly two-thirds.\n\nBeyond WLFI, Trump-linked entities also hold billions in other digital assets, including the TRUMP meme coin and stakes via Trump Media.\n\nSponsored Sponsored\n\nHowever, questions remain about whether the family can cash out. WLFI insiders are subject to strict trading limits, with only a small portion of tokens eligible for sale at launch.\n\nEven modest selling pressure could destabilize the price, a dynamic already seen with Trump-themed tokens that spiked and then crashed earlier this year.\n\n“With a low float, it’s easier to pump a price…It’s a good, explosive cocktail,” Bloomberg reported, citing Morten Christensen, founder of AirdropAlert.\n\nSponsored Sponsored\n\nSkeptics counter that the arrangement highlights the risks of insider-driven tokenomics, especially when intertwined with politics and public markets.\n\nWill WLFI become a blockbuster or fizzle under scrutiny? The outcome notwithstanding, its debut is significant because a US president’s family is at the center of one of the most controversial token launches in crypto history.\n\nTop crypto platforms in the US UpHold Explore COCA wallet Explore Robinhood Explore Coinbase Explore Kraken Explore\n\nTop crypto platforms in the US UpHold Explore COCA wallet Explore Robinhood Explore Coinbase Explore Kraken Explore\n\nTop crypto platforms in the US UpHold COCA wallet Robinhood Coinbase Kraken",

    "content": "Japan's leading bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet announced its latest purchase of 1,009 BTC for 16.48 billion Japanese yen ($112 million). Its total holdings reached 20,000 BTC, the company noted.\n\nAccording to its Monday disclosure, Metaplanet acquired the latest batch of bitcoin at an average price of around $111,068 per cryptocurrency.\n\nWith Monday's announcement, Metaplanet has become the sixth largest public bitcoin treasury company in the world, likely surpassing Riot Platforms, according to Bitcointreasuries.net data.\n\nThe event of Metaplanet's bitcoin holdings hitting 20,000 BTC came less than three months after the company announced having accumulated 10,000 BTC. Earlier this year, Metaplanet revised its year-end target to 30,000 BTC from its initial goal of 10,000 BTC.\n\nLast week, Metaplanet said it plans to raise 130 billion yen (about $880 million) through an international share offering and spend most of the proceeds buying bitcoin over the next two months.\n\nMetaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich previously said that it may borrow against its bitcoin holdings to buy cash-generating businesses in the future.\n\nMetaplanet's stock fell 2.62% on Monday morning in Japan with markets still open, according to Yahoo Finance data. The Block's MTPLF price page shows that the company's U.S.-listed stock closed last Friday up 0.83% at $6.11.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin is down 1.53% in the past 24 hours at $107,605, according to The Block's bitcoin price page.",

    "description": null,
    "content": "Japanese Bitcoin firm Metplanet has invested another 6.48 billion Japanese yen (roughly $112 million) to fund its treasury, which brought its total holdings to 20,000 BTC. With the latest acquisition, the company is climbing the corporate treasury ladder, but will it be able to dethrone the Michael Saylor-led Strategy?\n\nSummary Metaplanet has acquired 1009 BTC against a $112 million investment.\n\nThe company currently holds 20,000 BTC, making it the sixth-largest corporate holder.\n\nMetaplanet shares traded downwards after the latest disclosure.\n\nThe Tokyo-headquartered company said on Monday that it had acquired 1009 BTC at an average price of roughly $111,094 per Bitcoin. Its total Bitcoin stash is now valued at over $2.14 billion, based on the latest BTC price of $107,360 as of press time.\n\nCan Metaplanet surpass Strategy?\n\nAs of Sep. 1, Metaplanet ranks as the sixth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, as it is expected to surpass Bitcoin mining company Riot Platforms Inc., which held a Bitcoin stash of 19,239 BTC according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.\n\nThis recent purchase also brings it closer to its year-end target of holding at least 30,000 BTC in this treasury by the end of 2025.\n\nTo be able to achieve that target, the company would need to pick up 2500 BTC on average over the next four months. Initially, the plan was to acquire 10,000 BTC within the same time frame, but the company had blown past its original goal months ahead of schedule.\n\nWithin the next two years, the company would be chasing an even more ambitious target of holding 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply, which would constitute 210,000 BTC, by 2027.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin miner Hut 8 announces four new sites across the US\n\nEven if that happens, Metaplanet would still be lagging behind Strategy, which holds a whopping 632,457 BTC as of Sep. 1.\n\nMetaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich has disclosed on multiple occasions that the company’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy is inspired by Strategy’s corporate playbook. However, Strategy’s early entry, larger scale, and far more aggressive accumulation give it a strategic edge that Metaplanet may struggle to catch up to.\n\nNevertheless, Metaplanet’s pivot as a Bitcoin treasury firm, from a hotel operator, has paid off.\n\nBehind the headline numbers, Metaplanet continues to promote a unique metric called BTC Yield, a key performance indicator that measures the increase in Bitcoin holdings per fully diluted share over time.\n\nAccording to its latest filing, the company achieved a BTC Yield of 30.7% in the quarter-to-date period ending Sep. 1, building on the 129.4% yield from the previous quarter.\n\nTo bankroll these acquisitions, Metaplanet has leaned heavily on capital markets and has raised billions of yen by exercising multiple tranches of stock acquisition rights.\n\nBetween July 10 and Aug. 29, the company issued more than 80 million new shares, with most of the proceeds redirected toward early redemptions of bonds and new Bitcoin purchases.\n\nMetaplanet to meet shareholders over fresh funding\n\nThe timing of the latest acquisition coincides with an important shareholder meeting that the company scheduled last month to review and seek approval for a notable international share offering proposal.\n\nLast month, the company said it was considering another raise, which would provide $837 million in fresh capital against 555 million new shares. Its board has already given the plan a go, and the meeting would serve as the final step to secure shareholder consent before launching the overseas offering.\n\nNotably, Eric Trump, who currently serves as a member of Metaplanet’s Strategic Board of Advisors, is expected to attend this meeting.\n\nHowever, at the moment, shareholder sentiment has failed to match the company’s ambition. On Sep. 1, Metaplanet shares fell 3.87% during morning trading in Japan, as investors were likely weighing the dilution risks ahead of the shareholder meeting.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin (BTC) was down over 1% in the past 24 hours, changing hands at $107,664 when writing.\n\nStill, the stock remains one of Japan’s most volatile and talked-about assets in 2025 and has returned over 136% year-to-date, buoyed mainly by its Bitcoin strategy and high-profile inclusions on benchmark indexes like the FTSE Japan Index.",

    "description": null,
    "content": "Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading above the $4,400 level, showing resilience despite recent selling pressure and market-wide volatility. However, price action has entered a consolidation phase, with bulls struggling to reclaim higher levels and momentum appearing muted. This has fueled speculation across the market, as analysts remain divided on ETH’s next move.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nSolana Investors Cash Out Nearly $1-B As SOL Tests Key Price Level 1 day ago\n\nSome market participants expect Ethereum to retrace below $4,000, pointing to weakening momentum and sustained resistance near the $4,600–$4,800 range. They argue that a correction could provide healthier conditions for the next major leg upward. On the other hand, more optimistic analysts see this consolidation as a launchpad for a breakout, with ETH potentially pushing above the $5,000 mark in the coming weeks if demand remains strong.\n\nSupporting the bullish case, CryptoQuant data reveals that despite Ethereum’s ongoing correction following its recent all-time high, demand for ETH remains robust. Exchange reserves continue to trend lower as investors withdraw their holdings, while onchain activity highlights persistent accumulation. This divergence between price volatility and underlying demand suggests that ETH fundamentals remain solid.\n\nEthereum Demand Remains Strong Despite Correction\n\nAccording to CryptoQuant analyst Crypto SunMoon, Ethereum continues to demonstrate strong investor interest despite its recent price correction. After reaching new all-time highs, ETH has entered a consolidation phase, pulling back from peak levels. Yet, unlike many assets that typically see declining demand during corrections, Ethereum’s fundamentals show a different picture.\n\nData highlights a clear divergence between Ethereum and Bitcoin reserves on Binance. While Bitcoin reserves have remained relatively stable, Ethereum reserves have shown a persistent downward trend. This consistent outflow indicates that market participants are actively withdrawing ETH from exchanges, a common sign of accumulation. Investors appear more inclined to hold Ethereum in private wallets or deploy it in decentralized finance (DeFi), reflecting growing confidence in its long-term potential.\n\nThis trend also aligns with the broader capital rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum that has been unfolding in recent weeks. Reports of whales moving billions into ETH have repeatedly surfaced, reinforcing the narrative that large players are positioning for Ethereum’s next major move. Even as short-term volatility pressures the price, demand dynamics suggest that institutional and whale interest is not only intact but increasing.\n\nFor many analysts, this divergence between stable Bitcoin reserves and falling Ethereum reserves underscores Ethereum’s leadership in the current market cycle. While BTC remains the benchmark for crypto, ETH’s role as a cornerstone of DeFi, Layer 2 scaling, and institutional adoption continues to attract capital.\n\nUltimately, the resilience of Ethereum’s demand during a corrective phase signals strength beneath the surface. If accumulation persists, the consolidation period could set the stage for Ethereum’s next breakout, potentially pushing prices toward the $5,000 level and beyond.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nGalaxy Digital Sells 1,167 Bitcoin Amid Ongoing Volatility 1 day ago",

    "content": "California Governor Gavin Newsom has stirred fresh controversy by suggesting the launch of a parody cryptocurrency called the “Trump Corruption Coin.”\n\nNewsom floated the idea in an August 29 appearance on the Pivot podcast. He framed it as a response to President Donald Trump’s deepening involvement in the digital asset industry.\n\nWhy California Governor Wants to Launch a Trump Corruption Coin\n\nSponsored Sponsored\n\nAccording to Newsom, Trump’s long record of engagement with crypto firms has created an environment ripe for conflicts of interest.\n\n“This is just jaw-dropping. And none of this is normal. Again, none of this is funny. I mean, it’s funny in one respect, but it’s also extraordinary what’s going on. It’s jaw-dropping,” Newsom stated.\n\nNewsom also suggested that members of Trump’s family have entered into digital asset deals timed to coincide with policy decisions such as tariffs.\n\nSponsored Sponsored\n\nConsidering this, the governor said he would continue to call out the president’s “graft and corruption [and] self-dealing ” in the crypto industry.\n\nNewsom’s remarks underscored a broader argument that Trump’s crypto activities go beyond personal ventures and now intersect directly with his role in government.\n\nTrump’s involvement with blockchain projects has expanded considerably since his return to office in January.\n\nHe has promoted initiatives like the World Liberty Financial platform and its USD1 stablecoin, rolled out TRUMP-branded coins, and backed multiple NFT collections.\n\nHis son Eric Trump has been especially vocal, saying the family’s interest in crypto grew after traditional banks cut off their access to financial services.\n\nMeanwhile, these personal investments have coincided with broader policy actions.\n\nSponsored Sponsored\n\nHis administration has appointed pro-crypto officials like Howard Lutnick to key regulatory roles. It has also signed executive orders designed to integrate digital assets more deeply into mainstream finance.\n\nAccording to him, these steps position the United States as a leader in the fast-growing sector.\n\nHowever, Democrats contend that the overlap between Trump’s personal projects and regulatory agenda is blurring ethical boundaries.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren and other lawmakers have cautioned that the president’s influence over both policymaking and private ventures risks undermining trust in the regulatory process.\n\nAs a result, Democratic legislators have since introduced measures to restrict public officials from directly investing in cryptocurrencies.\n\nBest crypto platforms in Europe BTSE Explore YouHodler Explore NEXO Explore Wirex Explore MEXC Explore\n\nBest crypto platforms in Europe BTSE Explore YouHodler Explore NEXO Explore Wirex Explore MEXC Explore\n\nBest crypto platforms in Europe BTSE YouHodler NEXO Wirex MEXC",

Discover SCENE\n\nA federal judge on Friday handed prison terms totaling nearly eight years to two former executives at failed crypto lender Cred, whose actions fueled one of crypto’s worst investor losses.\n\nLegal experts told Decrypt that the sentences establish new precedents for executive accountability in crypto fraud cases.\n\nDaniel Schatt, former CEO and co-founder of Cred LLC, received 52 months in federal prison, while the firm's Chief Financial Officer Joseph Podulka was sentenced to 36 months.\n\nSenior U.S. District Judge William Alsup handed down the sentences after both men pleaded guilty in May to wire fraud conspiracy charges.\n\nThe executives misled customers about Cred's financial health while secretly funneling 80% of customer assets into high-risk microloans to Chinese gamers through an affiliated company.\n\n﻿\n\nWhen the scheme collapsed during 2020's crypto market crash, more than 440,000 customers lost $140 million, now worth over $1 billion at current prices.\n\nIshita Sharma, a blockchain and crypto lawyer and managing partner at Fathom Legal, told Decrypt that federal sentencing patterns in crypto fraud cases now clearly differentiate based on several key factors.\n\n\"Schatt's 52-month sentence is shorter than Sam Bankman-Fried's 25 years but longer than several plea-based cases,\" Sharma noted.\n\nShe said the sentences show courts weigh “loss amount, role in offense, and acceptance of responsibility,” with the 16-month gap between CEO and CFO reflecting “leadership hierarchy and culpability levels.”\n\n“Courts must balance individual circumstances with sending clear signals to the market,” Sharma said, noting that guilty pleas reduce exposure but sentences must still reflect “the severity of betraying customer trust in an emerging industry.”\n\nDuring a March 18, 2020 public session, Schatt told customers Cred was \"operating normally\" despite knowing the company faced a liquidity crisis.\n\nThe company lost an additional $9 million to a crypto scam and suffered further losses when Chief Capital Officer James Alexander allegedly appropriated approximately 255 BTC before being terminated.\n\nSharma said the Cred case reflects broader enforcement trends where \"courts increasingly consider the reputational damage to the entire crypto sector when sentencing individual executives.\"\n\nShe told Decrypt that judges now weigh whether sentences \"properly deter similar misconduct while maintaining proportionality to the specific harm caused.\"\n\nFor crypto platforms steering through regulatory uncertainty, Sharma said proactive disclosure is vital, urging a “‘regulation-by-analogy’ approach” that borrows from securities, banking, and commodities law.\n\n\"The key lesson from Cred is that opacity in gray zones invites aggressive enforcement—companies should over-disclose rather than exploit regulatory gaps,\" she said.\n\nBoth men will begin serving their terms on October 28, followed by three years of supervised release. A restitution hearing is scheduled for October 7.\n\nIn addition to prison time, Judge Alsup ordered each man to pay $25,000 fines and serve three years of supervised release.",

    "description": null,
    "content": "The race to bring more crypto assets to the stock market as ETFs may leave most stuck on the sidelines, Galaxy Digital found.\n\nRegulation & Politics\n\nEfforts to speed up crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals in the United States may actually sideline most tokens in the foreseeable future, Galaxy Digital's research associate Lucas Tcheyan revealed in a recent report. The new research estimates that only 12 of the top 100 assets by market capitalization beyond BTC and ETH would make the cut.\n\nIn late July, Cboe’s BZX Exchange, Nasdaq, and NYSE Arca all filed 19b-4 forms with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to propose listing standards for crypto ETFs that would replace today’s case-by-case system.\n\nThe applications come as the SEC faces a pileup of 91 pending crypto ETF requests covering 24 tokens and several index products, per Galaxy’s report. And while the agency’s final possible deadline for a verdict is March 27, 2026, Tcheyan thinks the call will likely come earlier, due to a “friendlier SEC attitude toward crypto.”\n\nShort List\n\nFor now, only 10 tokens qualify under the fast-track criteria: Dogecoin (DOGE), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Avalanche (AVAX), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Polkadot (DOT), Solana (SOL), and Hedera (HBAR), according to the Galaxy Digital report.\n\nCardano (ADA) and XRP are also expected to join them in September and October respectively, once the two assets pass the required six months of regulated futures trading, Tcheyan writes.\n\n“We view these as more likely to see ETF launches given their qualification under the proposed fast-track rule, and very likely if the rule is accepted,” Tcheyan wrote, referring to the above assets.\n\nTokens listed on Coinbase derivates and that meet ETF fast-track requirements. Source: Galaxy Digital\n\nOf those, nine tokens already have ETF applications on file, making them front-runners if the rule is adopted. Tcheyan says XRP and SOL could also squeak in through another path as each already has futures-based ETFs with “no less than 40% of their NAV” tied to the underlying token.\n\nWhy Only 12 Tokens?\n\nThe fast-track process hinges on three conditions: tokens must trade on a monitored exchange through the Intermarket Surveillance Group (ISG), have a six-month history of regulated futures trading, or be backed by a futures ETF holding at least 40% of the asset.\n\nAs of press time, no crypto asset beyond BTC and ETH meets the first condition because no spot crypto markets are ISG members. While Coinbase’s derivatives exchange is part of the group, it only covers futures rather than spot trading, Tcheyan explains.\n\nThat could change if the CFTC’s new “Crypto Sprint” or the SEC’s “Project Crypto” open doors for regulated spot markets, though the timeframe remains unclear.\n\nTcheyan wrote in the report that the lack of regulated crypto ETFs “has not dampened demand for exposure,” but instead, has redirected capital “into alternatives such as digital asset treasury management firms, private trusts, and structured products.”\n\nIn late August, Geoffrey Kendrick, the global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, argued that Ethereum treasury companies are trading at attractive levels, adding they’re offering better value than U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs.",

According to Charles, the Head of Solana Ecosystem at WLFI, there is already $30 million pool on Raydium, providing the stablecoin with immediate access to Solana’s vast DeFi user base.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/CharlesWLFI/status/1962350470975889552\n\nWorld Liberty Financial (WLFi), recognized for its emphasis on compliant and institution-ready digital assets, provides the regulatory expertise and reserve transparency necessary to attract mainstream companies and cautious investors. When combined, they indicate Solana’s growing popularity as a blockchain for future financial products.\n\nWhat Makes USD1 Special\n\nThe value of the USD1 is backed 1:1 by a reserve mix consisting of liquid assets, fiat deposits, and U.S. Treasury bills, making it a fully collateralized, dollar-pegged stablecoin. Leading custodians, including BitGo, are responsible for overseeing USD1’s reserves, and they are also subject to independent third-party audits. This adds a degree of security and regulatory clarity that was frequently lacking from previous stablecoin attempts.\n\nSome of the features of the Donald Trump-tied stablecoin include:\n\nCross-Chain Utility: USD1 is a highly flexible stablecoin for traders using various platforms, as it is compatible with Ethereum, Tron, BNB Chain, and Solana, among other blockchains.\n\nUSD1 is a highly flexible stablecoin for traders using various platforms, as it is compatible with Ethereum, Tron, BNB Chain, and Solana, among other blockchains.

    "description": null,
    "content": "KEY FACTS : Tether, the leading stablecoin issuer, has launched USDT on the RGB protocol to enable native stablecoin transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. This integration leverages RGB’s client-side validation and compatibility with the Lightning Network to offer private, scalable, and low-cost USDT transactions, including offline capabilities. With a market cap exceeding $167 billion, USDT’s move to RGB aims to enhance Bitcoin’s utility for payments and DeFi, building on Tether’s prior Bitcoin investments and Taproot Assets integration. The launch, announced in Lugano, Switzerland, positions Bitcoin as a cornerstone for decentralized finance.\n\n\n\nSources: Tether\n\nTether to Launch USDT on RGB Protocol, Pioneering Native Stablecoin Integration on Bitcoin\n\nTether, the world’s leading stablecoin issuer, has announced its plan to launch its flagship stablecoin, USD₮ (USDT), on the RGB protocol, a next-generation platform designed to issue and transact digital assets directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. This strategic integration, revealed in a press release on August 28, 2025, marks a significant step toward embedding stablecoin functionality natively within Bitcoin’s ecosystem, enhancing its utility beyond its traditional role as a store of value. Tether is leveraging RGB’s innovative technology to deliver fast, private, and scalable stablecoin transactions, reinforcing Bitcoin’s position as the cornerstone of a decentralized financial future.\n\nThe announcement comes on the heels of RGB’s mainnet launch with its 0.11.1 release in July 2025, which introduced advanced capabilities for tokenized assets and smart contracts on Bitcoin and its Lightning Network. RGB, an acronym for “Really Good Bitcoin,” is an open-source protocol that enables the issuance and management of digital assets, including stablecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and custom tokens, directly on Bitcoin’s infrastructure. Unlike traditional blockchain-based token systems, RGB employs client-side validation, keeping most transaction data off-chain while anchoring cryptographic proofs to Bitcoin transactions. This design minimizes blockchain congestion, enhances user privacy, and ensures compatibility with the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s layer-2 scaling solution known for its low-cost and near-instant transactions.\n\nTether’s decision to bring USDT to RGB underscores its commitment to expanding the reach and functionality of stablecoins, particularly on the world’s most secure and decentralized blockchain. “Bitcoin deserves a stablecoin that feels truly native, lightweight, private, and scalable,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “With RGB, USD₮ gains a powerful new pathway on Bitcoin, reinforcing our belief in Bitcoin as the foundation of a freer financial future.” Ardoino’s statement reflects Tether’s vision of transforming Bitcoin into a robust platform for everyday financial applications, including payments, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nThe RGB protocol represents a paradigm shift for Bitcoin, which has historically been viewed primarily as a store of value akin to digital gold. By enabling private, scalable, and user-controlled asset issuance, RGB allows stablecoins like USDT to operate natively on Bitcoin’s blockchain without relying on secondary networks like Ethereum or Tron, where USDT has predominantly circulated. With a market capitalization exceeding $167 billion and a daily trading volume of approximately $117.9 billion, USDT remains the dominant stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, serving as a critical liquidity pair for exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and cross-border settlements.\n\nRGB’s architecture offers several key advantages for USDT users. First, it allows users to hold and transfer both Bitcoin and USDT within the same wallet, streamlining the user experience and reducing reliance on external exchanges or bridged assets. Second, RGB’s client-side validation ensures that transaction details remain private, with only minimal cryptographic commitments recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain. This enhances confidentiality compared to legacy token systems, such as Omni Layer, which Tether recently phased out due to scalability limitations. Third, RGB’s compatibility with the Lightning Network enables near-instant, low-cost transactions, making USDT on Bitcoin a viable option for microtransactions, remittances, and retail payments, even in regions with limited internet access.\n\nPerhaps most notably, RGB supports offline transactions, allowing users to transfer USDT without an active internet connection, provided they securely manage their cryptographic proofs. This feature enhances the resilience and accessibility of stablecoin payments, particularly in emerging markets where connectivity may be unreliable. The combination of Bitcoin’s unmatched security with Tether’s stable value promises to unlock new use cases for Bitcoin, from everyday commerce to institutional settlements.\n\nTether’s move to launch USDT on RGB aligns with its strategy to diversify its network support while prioritizing high-demand ecosystems. In July 2024, Tether announced plans to wind down support for five legacy blockchains: Omni Layer, Bitcoin Cash SLP, Kusama, EOS, and Algorand, due to their limited scalability and declining usage. By contrast, RGB offers a forward-looking solution that aligns with Tether’s goal of integrating stablecoins into Bitcoin’s infrastructure, which remains the most secure and decentralized blockchain in existence.\n\nThe company’s commitment to Bitcoin extends beyond stablecoin issuance. Tether has made significant investments in Bitcoin-related infrastructure, including over $2 billion in 15 mining facilities across Latin America and a substantial holding of over 100,000 BTC as of Q2 2025. Additionally, Tether holds a majority stake in Twenty One Capital, a firm planning to go public with 43,514 BTC, positioning Tether as one of the largest public holders of Bitcoin. These investments signal Tether’s long-term confidence in Bitcoin as the backbone of the decentralized financial system.\n\nThe integration of USDT with RGB also builds on Tether’s earlier efforts to bring stablecoins to Bitcoin’s ecosystem. On January 30, 2025, Tether announced the integration of USDT with Bitcoin’s base layer and Lightning Network via Taproot Assets, a protocol developed by Lightning Labs. This earlier initiative, announced in El Salvador, aimed to combine Bitcoin’s decentralization with the Lightning Network’s speed and scalability. The RGB integration represents a complementary approach, focusing on privacy and off-chain scalability while maintaining Bitcoin’s security guarantees.\n\nTether’s launch of USDT on RGB has far-reaching implications for both the Bitcoin ecosystem and the broader stablecoin market, which is approaching a record $300 billion in total market capitalization. Tether, in enabling native stablecoin support, is addressing a key limitation of Bitcoin’s historical focus on value storage, positioning it as a viable platform for everyday transactions and DeFi applications. The integration is expected to boost liquidity within Bitcoin’s ecosystem, attracting new developers, institutions, and users to layer-2 solutions like RGB and the Lightning Network.\n\nFrom a trading perspective, the launch could enhance the efficiency of USDT-BTC trading pairs, which remain among the most liquid in the crypto market. Analysts suggest that the integration may lead to lower transaction fees and faster settlement times compared to Ethereum- or Tron-based USDT, potentially driving increased trading volume. Historical patterns indicate that stablecoin integrations often correlate with 10-15% spikes in 24-hour trading volumes for BTC-USDT pairs on major exchanges, and traders are advised to monitor Bitcoin’s price momentum around key resistance levels of $60,000 to $65,000.\n\nThe move will likely encourage more institutional adoption and cross-chain interoperability. As major firms like Stripe and Uber explore stablecoins for cross-border settlements, Tether’s Bitcoin-native USDT could attract institutional investors seeking compliance-friendly, high-liquidity assets. Additionally, RGB’s ability to issue and manage assets on Bitcoin opens the door for other stablecoins and tokenized assets to follow, fostering greater interoperability between Bitcoin and other blockchains.\n\nThe announcement, made in Lugano, Switzerland, a hub for blockchain innovation, also highlights Tether’s role in driving industry-wide collaboration. The RGB Protocol Association has welcomed Tether’s initiative as a strong signal for developers and institutions seeking scalable, user-controlled asset rails on Bitcoin. As wallets and infrastructure providers rally around RGB’s capabilities, the integration of USDT could catalyze broader adoption of Bitcoin-native stablecoins, paving the way for a new era of decentralized finance.\n\nInformation Sources:\n\nIf you found the article interesting or helpful, please hit the upvote button and share for visibility to other hive friends to see.

The integration follows previous launches on Ethereum, BNB Chain, and TRON.\n\nSummary World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin goes live on the Solana blockchain, including support from platforms like Raydium, BONK.fun and Kamino Finance.\n\nUSD1 has already been integrated into Ethereum, BNB Chain and TRON.\n\nTrump family-backed World Liberty Financial announced through its latest post that USD1 has now gone live on the Solana (SOL) blockchain. This means that users can now deploy the stablecoin across Solana-supported protocols like Raydium, Kamino Finance, and others for liquidity provision, lending, and yield farming.\n\nBy bringing USD1 into Solana, users will be able to take advantage of the blockchain’s fast transaction speeds and low fees to make stabelcoin transactions. This is because Solana is known for its high throughput and low fees compared, particularly compared to Ethereum (ETH) or BNB Chain (BNB) which also host USD1.\n\n“USD1 is one of the fastest-growing stablecoins in crypto, now live on Solana, where it belongs.

Therefore, USD1’s presence could potentially boosting liquidity depth and reducing slippage within Solana’s DeFi markets.\n\nNot only that, USD1 will also be connected to platforms like BONK.fun and other community-based platforms on Solana. This means that WLFI may be trying to tap into Solana’s retail and meme-driven culture. For users, this could mean airdrops, rewards, or incentives to adopt USD1 in its early stages.\n\nWorld Liberty Financial’s native token launch\n\nUSD1’s integration into Solana goes live on the same day as World Liberty Financial’s WLFI token debut on major crypto exchanges like Binance, Bybit, OKX, KuCoin and more. At press time, the trading data for the token is not available yet.\n\nHowever, data for perpetual contracts that was launched one month is available.

However, the token experienced a slight correction which highlights profit-taking and hesitancy.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index reflects this cooling momentum: after spiking into overbought territory above 70 during the rally, it has since returned to a neutral zone around 47 until 53. This indicates that buying pressure has eased, and WLFI is consolidating rather than continuing its parabolic move.",

Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin extended last week’s correction, closing the month on a negative note, with experts awaiting key macroeconomic data that could shape the U.S. Federal Reserve’s upcoming rate cut decision.\n\nThe spotlight is on the trifecta of jobless claims, U.S. productivity, and the August jobs report as the Fed faces conflicting data points with rising inflation and a weakening jobs market.\n\n“The Fed is walking a tightrope,” Kurt S. Altrichter, founder of Ivory Hill Wealth Advisory, said in an X post on Sunday. Cutting rates \"too soon risks reigniting 1970s-style inflation,\" while holding them steady could \"trigger a recession\" by breaking the labor market, Altrichter added.\n\n﻿\n\nThe pressure on Chair Jerome Powell, as a result, is immense, making this week's data releases more critical than usual.\n\nAll eyes are now on Thursday's initial jobless claims, which track new applications for unemployment benefits.\n\nWhile the consensus forecast of 230,000 claims aligns with the prior week’s 229,000, a reading above this threshold would signal a further softening of the labor market and add significant pressure on the Fed to consider slashing interest rates.\n\nFollowing closely on the same day is the final revision of U.S. Productivity and Unit Labor Costs.\n\nThe preliminary Q2 2025 productivity growth is set at +2.4% quarter-over-quarter annualized, with unit labor costs at +1.6%, down from the first quarter’s 6.9%, according to the August report.\n\nA downward revision in productivity or an upward revision in unit labor costs would raise concerns about persistent inflationary pressures, as higher labor costs per unit of output could signal wage-driven price increases.\n\nFriday’s Unemployment Rate and Nonfarm Payrolls forecasts peg the unemployment rate at 4.3%, up from July's 4.2%, with payrolls adding 75,000 jobs, up slightly from July’s 73,000 and wages up 0.3% month-over-month.\n\n“We expect payrolls to come in below consensus, around 40,000–60,000 versus 75,000 expected, with unemployment likely rising to 4.3%” Xu Han, director of Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital, told Decrypt.\n\nHe cautioned that hiring is weakening gradually, but the markets may be “underestimating the risk of larger layoffs ahead,\" a scenario that could push the Fed toward not just a single 25-basis-point cut in September, but \"a series of cuts beyond\" into late 2025.\n\nThis perspective is counterintuitive as it suggests that a weaker growth and employment report might not be a negative for Bitcoin.\n\nInstead, it could provide the clarity investors need on the Fed’s rate path, acting as a green light for risk assets like Bitcoin by boosting expectations of looser monetary policy and increased liquidity.\n\nRegardless, experts remain cautious of Bitcoin due to bearish September seasonality.\n\n“As we enter a more volatile September—typically the weakest seasonal month—with Bitcoin trading near a fragile equilibrium, we recommend focusing on the medium short-term holder cost basis,” Han said.\n\nBitcoin ended August with a 6.47% loss and is currently trading at $107,500, according to CoinGecko data.",

    "content": "Bitcoin price has fallen below $108,000 but on-chain and trading data suggest the market is holding firm, with institutional demand and technical signals pointing to a resilient setup.\n\nSummary Bitcoin trades at $107,820, down 13% from August’s all-time high.\n\nSpot and derivatives volumes jumped, showing stronger market activity.\n\nOn-chain data and technical indicators highlight structural support.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) slipped to $107,820 on Monday, marking a 1% decline in the past 24 hours. The asset has traded between $107,414 and $113,220 over the past week, leaving it down 4% in seven days and 5.4% in the last month. From its Aug. 14 peak of $124,128, Bitcoin now sits 13% lower.\n\nMarket activity has increased despite the price pullback. Spot trading volume rose 30% in the last day to $30.6 billion, while derivatives data from Coinglass showed a sharp rise in participation.\n\nFutures volume climbed 44.55% to $58.42 billion and open interest edged higher to $80.41 billion. This combination suggests new positions are being opened, rather than old ones being closed, pointing to higher conviction among active traders.\n\nOn-chain signals show strong support\n\nAccording to a Sept. 1 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor XWIN Research Japan, two structural indicators, Delta Cap and the Coinbase Premium Gap, continue to reinforce Bitcoin’s underlying strength.\n\nDelta Cap, which is currently $739.4 billion with an implied price of $108,900, is determined by the difference between Realized Cap and Average Cap. In the past, this metric has served as a cycle floor, helping to identify periods when consistent capital inflows supported the value of Bitcoin.\n\nYou might also like: Bitcoin price prediction: $108K–$115K range sets the stage for next big move\n\nThe fact that Bitcoin’s spot price is comfortably above Delta Cap suggests that investors remain confident despite short-term corrections,\n\nThe Coinbase Premium Gap, which compares the prices of Coinbase and Binance, is currently at +11.6. A positive premium indicates stronger demand from U.S. institutions willing to pay more for Bitcoin. In previous cycles, sustained premiums often preceded upward legs, suggesting new institutional accumulation.\n\nBitcoin price technical analysis\n\nThe BTC market is consolidating just above a key psychological support at $107,000. On the daily chart, Bitcoin is moving along the lower band of its Bollinger range, suggesting that it is in near-term oversold conditions.\n\nBitcoin daily chart. Credit: crypto.news\n\nThe relative strength index is close to neutral but leans lower, so if buying momentum picks up, there could be a bounce. The MACD signals are flattening, which often precedes a potential reversal, but they are still a little bearish.\n\nA sustained move above $110,000 may open the door to $113,000 and eventually retests around $118,000, but a break below $107,000 increases the likelihood of a decline toward $104,000.",

I don’t do that much; I post tweets and encourage people to build. I’m a cheerleader,” he said.\n\nWith more than 4,000 decentralized applications now active, including PancakeSwap and Aster, BNB Chain has become one of the largest ecosystems in the industry.\n\nCZ noted that stablecoin usage has nearly doubled this year. Meanwhile, real-world assets (RWAs) are beginning to take shape despite regulatory and liquidity challenges.\n\nAt #BNBDay Japan, @cz_binance shared his vision for BNB Chain and the future of Web3. From DeFi to RWAs to AI, his message was clear: the next chapter belongs to builders.\n\n\n\nRead the full recap of his fireside chat here 👇https://t.co/qZG2W7C7TI — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) August 31, 2025\n\nWhile he acknowledged that he holds many BNB tokens, which account for a significant portion of his worth, CZ stated that he sees decentralized finance (DeFi) overtaking centralized exchanges.\n\n“DEX volumes are very likely to exceed CEX in the future. DeFi is the future. And normal trading should be privacy-preserving,” he said.\n\nSponsored Sponsored\n\nIf starting from scratch today, CZ said he would focus on building an AI-powered trading agent and a privacy-preserving perpetual DEX. He also pointed to RWAs and stablecoins as areas of massive opportunity.\n\n“Securities, treasuries, and commodities have huge potential. But regulation, KYC, and liquidity are major challenges,” he acknowledged.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Binance executive highlighted BNB Chain’s investments into partnerships with issuers such as Securitize and Backed.\n\nJapan, he argued, is well-positioned to play a leading role in this next chapter of Web3.\n\n“I would love to see a dedicated BNB Chain team here, and more projects that bring together robotics, AI, and Web3,” CZ shared.\n\nSponsored Sponsored\n\nJapan Post Bank’s Digital Currency Push\n\nWhile CZ looked at the future of global DeFi, Japan’s financial sector is preparing for a leap of its own.\n\nJapan Post Bank announced it will issue the DCJPY digital currency in fiscal 2026. The move would enable depositors to instantly convert savings into digital money for trading blockchain-based assets.\n\nLocal media reports that the bank manages ¥190 trillion ($1.29 trillion) in deposits across 120 million accounts. By integrating blockchain rails into its core services, it hopes to revitalize dormant balances and attract younger customers.\n\nDCJPY, developed by DeCurret DCP, will be pegged 1:1 to the yen and usable for purchasing security tokens and NFTs (non-fungible tokens).\n\nSponsored Sponsored\n\nThe move could significantly improve trading efficiency by enabling instant settlement of tokenized securities. Japan Post Bank also envisions government subsidies and grants distributed via DCJPY, further embedding digital money into daily life.\n\nMeanwhile, the Boston Consulting Group and Ripple say the tokenized RWA market could expand from $600 billion in 2025 to $18.9 trillion by 2033.\n\nEstimated Growth in Tokenization through 2033.

    "description": null,
    "content": "On Friday, the Ethereum Foundation outlined a multi-track roadmap to make Ethereum feel “like one chain again,” publishing a protocol update that prioritizes faster confirmations, trust-minimized cross-chain interactions, and new UX and privacy tooling on crypto’s second-largest blockchain.\n\nThe plan introduces a trio of workstreams dubbed “Initialisation,” “Acceleration,” and “Finalisation.” It also shares deliverables and target dates extending into 2026, according to the official blog post.\n\nUnder the Initialisation stream, EF engineers and ecosystem teams are rolling out an Open Intents Framework that lets users express desired outcomes. Additionally, developers proposed an Ethereum Interoperability Layer aimed at facilitating trustless transactions across Layer 2 networks, along with a set of standards designed to reduce friction.\n\n\"The Ethereum Interoperability Layer (EIL) focuses on making Ethereum feel like one chain again, without compromising on CROPS values (censorship-resistance, open-source, privacy, and security), developers wrote. Production contracts for the intents framework are live, with audits and a reference solver due by Q4 2025. A public design document for the Interoperability Layer is scheduled for release in October.\n\nAcceleration, the second stream, targets latency. A fast L1 confirmation rule—giving strong confirmations in roughly 15–30 seconds—will be specified and implemented across consensus clients, with broad availability targeted for Q1 2026.\n\nParallel work explores halving slot times from 12 seconds to 6 seconds to shorten the inclusion and finality periods. There are also plans to support optimistic rollups that adopt ZK-based real-time proving or a secure “2-of-3” faster settlement mechanism to reduce withdrawal delays.\n\nThe Finalisation stream pushes toward research and development of real-time proving, or snarkification, for cross-chain settlement and materially faster Layer 1 finality. Snarkifying or snarkification refers to utilizing zero-knowledge proofs, specifically ZK-SNARKS, to improve the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) environment.\n\nAccording to the Aug. 29 blog update, developers are exploring options such as changes to the beacon chain, three-slot finality designs, and alternative consensus protocols that reduce finality to seconds if proven safe and decentralized.\n\nThe latest protocol update ties the UX agenda to two ongoing EF initiatives aimed at advancing Ethereum’s global computer plan. First, Phase 2 of the “Trillion Dollar Security” program, which focuses on safer signing, key management, and wallet standards.\n\nIt also links to “Kohaku,” a privacy wallet effort co-led by Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin and EF coordinator Nicolas Consigny. It aims to ship an SDK and an advanced browser extension with private addresses, balances, and sends backed by a light client.\n\nIn other related news, onchain activity on Ethereum has surged while developers work to improve the blockchain's engine room. The Block reported that monthly onchain volume surpassed $320 billion, a four-year high and the third-highest level ever.",

    "title": "What to Expect From Ethereum in September",
    "description": null,
    "content": "Ethereum (ETH) price seems to be ending August on a strong note, gaining over 23% and breaking a three-year streak of negative August performances. Unlike Bitcoin, which has struggled through the month, the ETH price has shown resilience.\n\nHowever, September has historically been one of Ethereum’s weaker months, with only marginal gains of 3.20% in 2024 and 1.49% in 2023 after a series of red Septembers before that. Now, with the charts flashing mixed signals, ETH could be headed for a choppy month.\n\nLong-Term Holders May Book Profits\n\nOne key metric to watch is Ethereum’s Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL), which measures the overall profitability of holders.\n\nSponsored Sponsored\n\nA high NUPL means most wallets are sitting on profits, often a signal that some may take profit. Ethereum’s long-term holder NUPL currently sits at 0.62, close to its three-month high.\n\nEthereum Holders Might Book Profits: Glassnode\n\nIn the past, similar levels have triggered corrections. On August 17, when NUPL touched 0.63, ETH fell from $4,475 to $4,077 (-8.9%). Later that month, at 0.66, ETH dropped from $4,829 to $4,380 (-9.3%). This suggests that September could bring volatility or range-bound action.\n\nEthereum Price’s Historical Performance: CryptoRank\n\nHistorically, September hasn’t been ETH’s strongest month. That history, combined with high NUPL, supports the case for choppiness.\n\nFor token TA and market updates: Want more token insights like this? Sign up for Editor Harsh Notariya’s Daily Crypto Newsletter here.\n\nStill, long-term fundamentals remain supportive of a price surge. In an exclusive interview with BeInCrypto, Kevin Rusher, CEO of RAAC, explained:\n\n“In September, I expect the drivers for Ethereum’s price to remain largely the same as they are today, key among these the growing trend of companies buying up ETH for their treasuries. In fact, just this week, Standard Chartered named this as the main reason for increasing its ETH price target to $7,500, he mentioned”\n\nSponsored Sponsored\n\nThis treasury accumulation trend, alongside Ethereum’s role in DeFi and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, could help cushion downside moves even if near-term volatility persists.\n\nCost Basis Heatmap Highlights Critical Resistance\n\nAnother important metric is the Cost Basis Heatmap, which shows where ETH was last accumulated. These zones often act as natural support or resistance.\n\nKey ETH Accumulation Clusters: Glassnode\n\nThe strongest support cluster lies between $4,323 and $4,375, where more than 962,000 ETH were accumulated. Below that, additional zones exist at $4,271–$4,323 (418,872 ETH) and $4,219–$4,271 (329,451 ETH), providing buffers in case the Ethereum price dips.\n\nThe heavier challenge lies higher. Between $4,482 and $4,592, nearly 1.9 million ETH were accumulated, making this a formidable resistance zone.\n\nSponsored Sponsored\n\nIf the ETH price clears this, momentum could extend toward $4,956. More on this later when we discuss the Ethereum price action\n\nTechnical Charts Signal At Ethereum Price Choppiness\n\nThe 2-day Ethereum price chart shows that it has broken below an ascending trendline. This doesn’t confirm a bearish reversal, but it does suggest fading bullish momentum.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the speed and strength of price movements, has formed a bearish divergence — with price making higher highs while RSI trended lower.\n\nThis typically signals weakening strength and a likelihood of range-bound trading, more so if it forms on a longer timeframe.\n\nSponsored Sponsored\n\nEthereum Price Analysis: TradingView\n\nIf ETH reclaims $4,579 (almost breaking the cost basis resistance), upside momentum could return, with the key target at $4,956.\n\nOn the downside, watch $4,345 and $4,156 as important support levels. A break below $4,156 could open further downside risks, while a sustained hold above $4,579 keeps $4,956 (close to $5,000, which is a key psychological level) within reach.\n\nHowever, for Ethereum, that level couldn’t just be the start of something bigger, as summed up by Rusher.\n\nSponsored Sponsored\n\n“Yes, $5,000 is still a meaningful milestone. Psychologically, investors like round numbers, plus it’s a fresh all-time high. Once ETH gets past the $5,000 mark, it will eventually become a strongly defended support level, he added”\n\nHowever, if the Ethereum price closes under $4,156 with a complete 2-day candle, the bullish narrative might take some more time to materialize.\n\nAnd with the long-term holder NUPL closing in on 3-month highs, talks regarding choppiness find more weight.\n\nTop crypto platforms in the US UpHold Explore COCA wallet Explore Robinhood Explore Coinbase Explore Kraken Explore\n\nTop crypto platforms in the US UpHold Explore COCA wallet Explore Robinhood Explore Coinbase Explore Kraken Explore\n\nTop crypto platforms in the US UpHold COCA wallet Robinhood Coinbase Kraken",

    "title": "Institutional Money Floods Into Ethereum: Is a 100x Price Surge on the Horizon?",
    "description": null,
    "content": "Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin has made waves in the cryptocurrency community with a bold prediction that could reshape investment strategies for years to come. In a recent social media post responding to Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, Lubin declared that “ETH will likely 100x from here. Probably much more,” suggesting Ethereum could reach an astronomical $440,000 based on current prices around $4,400.\n\nThis isn’t just wishful thinking from a crypto enthusiast. Lubin’s prediction is grounded in his belief that Wall Street firms will increasingly stake ETH as they migrate their financial infrastructure to blockchain technology, creating unprecedented demand for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency.\n\nRecord-Breaking Institutional Adoption Drives Ethereum Demand\n\nThe timing of Lubin’s forecast couldn’t be more relevant, as institutional money is pouring into Ethereum at record rates. Recent data reveals that Ethereum ETFs attracted $4 billion in net inflows during August alone, dramatically outpacing Bitcoin ETFs which experienced $803 million in outflows during the same period.\n\nBlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has emerged as a powerhouse, accumulating $27.6 billion in assets under management. The fund recorded a single-day influx of $500.85 million on August 25, demonstrating the voracious appetite institutional investors have developed for Ethereum exposure.\n\nRegulatory Clarity Unlocks Capital Flows\n\nThe regulatory environment has proven instrumental in this institutional rush. The SEC’s reclassification of Ethereum as a utility token in 2025, combined with approval of in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms for Ethereum ETFs, has removed significant barriers to institutional participation.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, up to 95% of Ethereum ETF holdings can now be staked, generating yields of 3-5% for institutional investors. This staking capability transforms Ethereum from a speculative asset into a yield-generating investment vehicle, making it particularly attractive to institutional portfolios seeking consistent returns.\n\nCorporate Treasuries Embrace Ethereum at Scale\n\nBeyond ETFs, corporate treasuries are adding Ethereum to their balance sheets in unprecedented quantities. Treasury companies like Bitmine Immersion and Sharplink Gaming have collectively added 2.6% of all ETH in circulation to their reserves since June 2025.\n\nBitmine now holds over 1.7 million ETH valued at approximately $7.6 billion, while Sharplink Gaming has accumulated nearly 800,000 ETH worth around $3.6 billion. These massive corporate purchases remove significant supply from the market while demonstrating institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition.\n\nAnalysts Echo Bullish Sentiment with Ambitious Price Targets\n\nLubin’s 100x prediction finds support among other prominent market analysts. Tom Lee of Fundstrat has set a five-year price target of $60,000 for ETH while predicting the cryptocurrency could reach $12,000 by year-end.\n\nLee’s analysis centers on Wall Street’s infrastructure transition to Ethereum. He argues that as even 20-30% of Wall Street’s infrastructure migrates to Ethereum, the network could justify valuations as high as $60,000 per token.\n\nVanEck analysts have added fuel to the bullish fire, projecting that Layer 2 networks could reach a $1 trillion market capitalization by 2030. This growth would further enhance Ethereum’s value proposition as the foundational layer for blockchain-based financial infrastructure.\n\nThe Ethereum “Flywheel Effect”\n\nSeveral fundamental factors create what analysts describe as a “flywheel effect” attracting additional capital to Ethereum:\n\n4-6% staking yields provide consistent returns for institutional investors\n\nprovide consistent returns for institutional investors Deflationary tokenomics reduce supply over time through EIP-1559 burn mechanisms\n\nreduce supply over time through EIP-1559 burn mechanisms 50% market share in real-world asset tokenization establishes Ethereum as the dominant platform for institutional use cases\n\nestablishes Ethereum as the dominant platform for institutional use cases 29.6% of circulating supply now staked, reducing available tokens for trading\n\nNavigating Near-Term Headwinds\n\nDespite the overwhelmingly bullish long-term outlook, Ethereum faces potential short-term volatility. September has historically been Ethereum’s most challenging month, averaging -6.42% returns since 2016.\n\nMarket analysts expect possible profit-taking and seasonal trends could pressure prices following Ethereum’s impressive 76% year-to-date gain. However, these near-term concerns pale in comparison to the fundamental drivers supporting massive long-term growth.\n\nThe Path to 100x: Infrastructure Migration as the Key Catalyst\n\nLubin’s 100x prediction hinges on a simple but powerful thesis: as traditional finance migrates to blockchain infrastructure, Ethereum will capture the majority of this value. With its established developer ecosystem, proven security track record, and regulatory clarity, Ethereum is positioned to become the backbone of Web3 financial infrastructure.\n\nThe combination of institutional adoption, corporate treasury allocation, and infrastructure migration creates multiple demand drivers that could support dramatic price appreciation over the coming years.\n\nInvestment Implications and Risk Considerations\n\nWhile Lubin’s prediction offers exciting possibilities for investors, it’s essential to consider both opportunities and risks:\n\nPotential Catalysts:\n\nContinued institutional ETF inflows\n\nIncreased corporate treasury adoption\n\nWall Street infrastructure migration\n\nLayer 2 ecosystem growth\n\nRegulatory clarity expansion\n\nRisk Factors:\n\nMarket volatility and corrections\n\nRegulatory changes\n\nCompetition from other blockchain platforms\n\nTechnical challenges or security issues\n\nMacroeconomic headwinds\n\nConclusion: A New Era for Ethereum\n\nJoseph Lubin’s bold 100x prediction reflects more than crypto enthusiasm—it represents a fundamental shift in how institutions view Ethereum’s role in the future of finance. With record institutional inflows, corporate adoption, and infrastructure migration already underway, the foundations for massive growth appear increasingly solid.\n\nWhether Ethereum reaches $440,000 remains to be seen, but the convergence of institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and technological advancement suggests we may be witnessing the early stages of a historic transformation in digital asset markets.\n\nFor investors, the key question isn’t whether Ethereum will grow, but rather how to position portfolios to benefit from what could be the most significant wealth creation opportunity in cryptocurrency history.",

    "description": null,
    "content": "A long-running legal battle against Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy has come to an abrupt end after lead plaintiffs and an investor voluntarily dismissed their claims.\n\nAccording to a filing on Thursday, plaintiffs Michelle Clarity, Mehmet Cihan Unlusoy, and investor Anas Hamza withdrew their lawsuit with prejudice, meaning the case cannot be reopened in the same or any other court under the same claim.\n\n“The dismissal with respect to Co-Lead Plaintiffs’ claims and Anas Hamza’s claims, but not absent class members’ claims, is with prejudice,” the court document confirmed. It also stated that the lawsuit had not been certified as a class action.\n\nLegal experts noted the finality of this outcome. Brandon Ferrick, general counsel at Duoro Labs, explained, “The dismissal with prejudice means that plaintiff does not get a second bite at the apple — they cannot amend the complaint and refile the suit. The case is over and cannot be re-filed in the same court, or any court, on the same claim.”\n\nOrigins of the Case\n\nThe lawsuit was originally brought against Strategy in May 2025.\n\nHamza, representing dissatisfied investors, alleged that the company and its executives misled shareholders regarding the risks and profitability of its Bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe filing quickly gained momentum, with at least eight law firms attempting to recruit additional investors in support of the claims.\n\nDespite the attention, the case now ends permanently without progressing to class action status, effectively clearing a major legal cloud over the company.\n\nStrategy’s Massive Bitcoin Holdings\n\nStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world.\n\nThe company began accumulating BTC in August 2020 and currently owns 632,457 Bitcoin, valued at around $68.4 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.\n\nThe scale of these holdings has made Strategy a centerpiece in debates about the role of digital assets on corporate balance sheets.\n\nWider Impact on Crypto Treasury Firms\n\nThe end of the case could have ripple effects across the industry.\n\nCrypto treasury companies have been expanding rapidly, diversifying beyond Bitcoin into other leading digital assets such as Ether, Solana, BNB, and Tron.\n\nThese firms increasingly resemble actively managed funds in their approach, according to legal experts.\n\n“We’re now seeing an emergence of crypto-based treasury companies that operate like actively managed ETFs, but in a company structure,” said crypto lawyer Tyler Yagman of The Ferraro Law Firm.\n\nHe added, “Management team needs to be as transparent as humanly possible and as direct as humanly possible, because you’re dealing with a market segment that is known to be volatile.”\n\nMarket Response\n\nStrategy’s share price has remained relatively stable despite the lawsuit headlines.\n\nOn Friday, the stock slipped just -0.8%, in line with the Nasdaq Index, suggesting investors had already priced in the risks and were largely unaffected by the dismissal news.\n\nThe conclusion of the case marks a significant win for Strategy and may set a precedent for how other crypto treasury companies defend themselves in future legal disputes.",

    "description": null,
    "content": "Fourteen men have been sentenced to life imprisonment by an anti-corruption court in India after they were convicted of involvement in a 2018 kidnapping of an Indian man targeted for his crypto holdings.\n\nThe convicts include 11 police officers, including the former superintendent of police in the district where the crime took place, and a former member of India's legislative assembly. The men were convicted under the Indian Penal Code for kidnapping, extortion, and criminal conspiracy by Special Judge B.B. Jadav in Ahmedabad, according to local news reports.\n\nThe complainant, Shailesh Bhatt, was allegedly lured to a gas station on February 9, 2018 by men posing as agents from India's Central Bureau of Investigation. Upon arriving, Bhatt was kidnapped and detained at a nearby farmhouse. Bhatt was then reportedly threatened by the police officers at gunpoint until he agreed to meet their ransom demands.\n\nThe kidnappers initially demanded 176 BTC plus ₹32 crore in cash (currently about $3.6 million USD), but following negotiations, Bhatt sold 34 BTC and transferred the proceeds, about $150,000 USD, to his abductors.

The new system, managed by ONBTC, maintains transparency through a dashboard displaying the total balance across all addresses while eliminating the need for address reuse.\n\nFollowing the transfer, each new wallet will hold up to 500 Bitcoin. Mononaut, the founder of Mempool, said that El Salvador had distributed the funds across 14 new addresses.\n\nEl Salvador's Bitcoin Office just migrated their Strategic Reserve holdings into 14 new addresses with up to 500 BTC per UTXO.

    "description": null,
    "content": "Sun 31 Aug 2025 ▪ 5 min read ▪ by Luc Jose A.\n\nShibarium collapses. In ten days, the daily transactions of the Shiba Inu layer 2 blockchain dropped from 4.8 million to less than 10,000, a fall of 99.8 %. This is not a slowdown, but a brutal stop. Launched a year ago as the engine of the SHIB ecosystem, the network is facing a spectacular loss of momentum. In a lethargic crypto market at this end of August, this plunge raises questions about the real adoption of this project, which is nevertheless highly exposed in the media.\n\nIn brief Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer 2 network, recorded a historic 99.8 % drop in its daily transactions in just ten days.\n\nThe volume dropped from 4.8 million to 9,590 transactions per day, with no technical outages reported, in a generally sluggish market context.\n\nDespite this sharp decline, Shibarium’s technical fundamentals remain solid with over 1.56 billion total transactions.\n\nBetween a warning signal and a simple downturn, Shibarium’s future will depend on its ability to revive adoption and offer concrete use cases.\n\nA brutal collapse of activity on Shibarium\n\nOn August 20, Shibarium, the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s layer 2 solution, was still processing about 4.8 million transactions per day, as institutional investors were taking position again. Ten days later, this figure dropped to 9,590 transactions, a spectacular fall of 99.8 %, according to official Shibariumscan data.\n\nSuch a sharp decline is rare, even in a market as volatile as crypto. It immediately attracted the attention of sector observers, in a context of general market gloom.\n\nTo better understand the extent of this decline, here are the main indicators :\n\nDaily transactions : 9,590 (compared to 4.8 million on August 20) ;\n\nRate of decline : -99.8 % in 10 days;\n\nThe drop seems behavioral in origin (user disengagement).\n\nThis slowdown raises questions on several levels. On one hand, it could indicate a temporary disaffection of the Shiba Inu community, in the absence of strong news or incentives. On the other hand, it reveals the fragility of a network still highly dependent on speculative dynamics and mass effects.\n\nIf no technical outage or attack is behind this drop, it means the trigger likely lies in users’ widespread wait-and-see attitude. Far from trivial, this signal could announce a deeper reconsideration of Shibarium’s place in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nSolid foundations, but dynamics to revive\n\nDespite this collapse in daily activity, the network’s fundamentals remain solid according to on-chain data. Indeed, Shibarium displays 1,566,119,160 cumulative transactions, 271,936,819 unique addresses, and 12,811,111 mined blocks.\n\nThe project celebrated its second anniversary, having launched in August 2023. This symbolic milestone reminds us that Shibarium’s infrastructure continues to operate, produce blocks, and maintain a user base, even in the absence of intense activity.\n\nAt the same time, the Shiba Inu ecosystem is attempting to consolidate its credibility in traditional financial markets. This week, asset manager Valour launched eight new ETPs denominated in Swedish krona on the Spotlight Stock Market of Sweden, including Shiba Inu among the selected assets. This integration marks an attempt to reposition the token in regulated financial products aimed at a European institutional investor audience.\n\nAdded to this is a series of alerts from the Shiba Inu team, aimed at strengthening community security. “Coordinated networks of malicious actors” have been identified, according to which investors are targeted by fake links and fraudulent tokens, notably an unofficial version of the LEASH token on Solana. The team reminds users that “any token not listed on the official SHIB site is fake” and urges users never to connect their wallets without prior verification.\n\nThis contrast between the network’s technical solidity and the drastic drop in activity reveals a strategic challenge: to revive adoption while protecting users to prevent them from recording losses. Shibarium’s future will depend on its ability to go beyond the hype and offer concrete, sustainable, and secure use cases. The two-year mark is both a milestone and a test. It will take more than a performant infrastructure to regain trust and user engagement in an increasingly demanding crypto market.\n\nMaximize your Cointribune experience with our \"Read to Earn\" program!

    "description": null,
    "content": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has given the crypto world a serious wake-up call. According to CoinGape, he says there’s about a 20% chance by 2030 that quantum computers could break the cryptography keeping Bitcoin safe. And by 2040, the risk could be much higher. His warning has traders, developers, and investors paying attention.\n\nQuantum Computers Could Shake Things Up\n\nQuantum computers are not like the devices we use every day. They use qubits, which can process data at very high speeds. Someday, they might be strong enough to crack the codes that protect Bitcoin wallets and transactions.\n\nFor now, Bitcoin is secure. Buterin is urging the crypto community to plan for the future. Even a 20% chance over the next ten years is enough to take action now. If people wait too long, they could be caught off guard.\n\nHow Bitcoin Could Be at Risk\n\nBitcoin relies on a system called ECDSA to keep wallets safe. Normally, this works perfectly. But a powerful quantum computer could figure out private keys from public keys. That would allow someone to steal Bitcoin or alter transactions.\n\nIt’s not happening today. But Buterin’s warning shows the importance of planning ahead. Acting now could prevent major headaches in the future.\n\nEthereum Is Planning Ahead\n\nButerin is also pushing Ethereum to stay ahead of the game. He’s exploring quantum-resistant cryptography to keep blockchains safe before quantum computers become a real problem.\n\nSome possible solutions include lattice-based cryptography or hash-based signatures. The idea is simple: start early, test carefully, and protect users’ funds. By moving now, Ethereum and other blockchains can stay ahead of the game.\n\nExperts Agree\n\nOther crypto experts share Buterin’s concerns. Dr. Aggelos Kiayias, a cryptography researcher, says even a small risk deserves attention. “The best time to prepare is before the first attack,” he notes.\n\nGovernments and institutions are also taking notice. Many are looking into quantum-safe protocols to protect billions in digital assets. The lesson is clear: preparation matters.\n\nWhat This Means for Crypto\n\nQuantum computers could change fields like medicine, AI, and technology. But they also bring new risks for crypto. For Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies, the lesson is clear: it’s time to start preparing. Test quantum-safe solutions and adopt secure protocols. Don’t wait until it’s too late.\n\nBottom Line\n\nVitalik Buterin isn’t just speculating. He’s sending a warning. The crypto world can’t ignore quantum threats. Getting ready with quantum-safe blockchains today can help protect crypto in the long term. The future is unpredictable, but preparing now can really pay off.",

Short-Term Traders Exposed to Warning Signals Show more\n\nOn 29th August, the Bitcoin ($BTC) market shows a strategic shift as crypto whales cashed out a staggering amount of $4 billion in realized profits. This advancement marks the largest profit-taking event since February 2025. It excludes the anomaly of July 4, when realized profits hit nearly $9 billion. Through this sudden move, concerns came out about the crypto market’s short-term instability and potential selling pressure.\n\n🚨 On-Chain Alert: Whales Take $4 Billion in Profit!\n\n\n\nYesterday (Aug 29), Bitcoin saw a massive $4B spike in Realized Profit, the largest since Feb (excluding the July 4 outlier).\n\n\n\nBreakdown:\n\n\n\n• >10k BTC Whales: $2.17B\n\n\n\n• 1k-10k BTC Whales: $1.25B\n\n\n\nThis is a clear signal of… pic.twitter.com/0leXfRdqT1 — CryptoOnchain (@CryptoOnchain) August 30, 2025\n\nCrypto Whales Take the Charge of Profit Tsunami\n\nThe mega whales hold more than 10,000 BTC, shaking the bulk of realized profits. In this way, Mega whales have secured $2.17 billion, a massive profit. Meanwhile, large whales hold 1,000–10,000 BTC, booking an additional $1.25 billion. The smaller affluent investors secured BTC in the range of 100-1,000 BTC, walking away with some $495 million. This collective sell-off highlights the strategy of crypto whales, large Bitcoin holders, to dictate the market momentum.\n\nThis type of large-scale profit-taking occurs near local price peaks, capitalizing on long-term holders’ rallies to lock in gains. Whales may consider this behavior rational, but it affects the broader market. With this large-scale activity, retail traders experience volatility.\n\nShort-Term Traders Exposed to Warning Signals\n\nWhile observing this sharp profit surge, analysts advise short-term traders to consider it as a red flag. This observation showcases the consolidation phase or potential corrections. This movement further refers to the transfer of Bitcoin from strong hands to weaker hands. Through this phenomenon, the crypto market experiences more vulnerability to sudden swings.\n\nThis phenomenal shift can not be considered as the beginning of a prolonged downturn. The collective act of whales can make quick sentiment shifts with this timing and sell-off strategy. Now, whale wallets are the main source of indications to consider an event as one-off profit-taking or the beginning of a broader selling trend.",

    "content": "Ethereum is trading at a critical level after several days of selling pressure and mounting speculation, with bulls struggling to maintain momentum as Bitcoin and the broader crypto market turn bearish. Price action has shifted into a cautious phase, and ETH now faces the challenge of defending key demand zones that could determine the weeks ahead.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nBitcoin Index Highlights Two Accumulations And Five Distribution Waves This Cycle – Details 3 days ago\n\nDespite this pullback, Ethereum remains the standout performer in the market. Fresh data from Glassnode reveals that over the past month, no altcoin sector has outperformed ETH, although DeFi and Layer 2 ecosystems came close. This resilience underscores Ethereum’s dominance even in times of broader market weakness, reinforcing its role as the backbone of decentralized finance and blockchain infrastructure.\n\nThe trend also suggests that the market is entering what many analysts describe as “Ethereum season,” where ETH leads performance and capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins begins to accelerate. With institutions, whales, and retail investors watching closely, Ethereum’s ability to hold its ground while others falter highlights its strength heading into the next stage of the cycle.\n\nEthereum Leads Market As Capital Rotation Accelerates\n\nAccording to Glassnode, Ethereum has established itself as the clear leader in the market over the past month. No altcoin sector has managed to outperform ETH during this period, with only DeFi and Layer 2 ecosystems coming close. Notably, most altcoin sectors ended the month in decline, reinforcing Ethereum’s relative strength in a volatile environment.\n\nThis performance signals a clear shift in capital rotation, as flows begin moving away from Bitcoin and into Ethereum, marking what many analysts see as the beginning of a new stage in the cycle.\n\nCapital rotation has long been a hallmark of crypto market dynamics. Traditionally, rallies begin with Bitcoin dominance before liquidity spreads into Ethereum and then, eventually, into smaller altcoins. The latest data shows ETH taking center stage in this process, attracting both institutional interest and whale accumulation. This suggests that investors view Ethereum as the next engine of growth, supported by strong fundamentals and expanding adoption across DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise use cases.\n\nStill, sentiment remains divided. Some analysts argue that this cycle is structurally longer, stretched by institutional products like spot ETFs and increased global adoption, meaning Ethereum could continue to outperform for months. Others remain cautious, warning that the market’s current weakness could be the early signal of a broader bearish trend.\n\nRegardless of these opposing views, Ethereum’s leadership in performance and its ability to outpace nearly every altcoin sector highlight its growing importance in defining the next stage of the crypto market. For many, ETH is setting the tone for where capital flows—and opportunities—are headed next.\n\nRelated Reading\n\nEthereum Exchange Reserves Decline – Strong Accumulation Signal 3 days ago",

    "title": "One year into Sky( Makerdao ), adoption lags behind vision",
    "description": null,
    "content": "On August 27, 2024, MakerDAO formally transitioned into Sky, a new identity meant to signal a fresh era of modular governance, ecosystem scaling, and real-world integrations.\n\nOne year later, the core pillars of that transformation are in place, but the adoption story remains mixed.\n\nThe renamed protocol now oversees over $7.8 billion in stablecoin liabilities across DAI and its successor USDS. But despite heavy investments in marketing incentives and ecosystem spinoffs, Sky’s headline stablecoin metrics have flatlined, or in some cases, reversed. Meanwhile, capital restructuring efforts and a sweeping token migration have begun reshaping protocol governance entirely.\n\nThe organizations’ financials are also a bit of a puzzle, Sky co-founder Rune Christensen said during a community call Wednesday.\n\n“We have three different ways of measuring this stuff, and none of the three tend to agree,” said Christensen. He described the gap between on-chain PnL estimates, like the Steakhouse report ($8 million Q2 profit), and dashboard forecasts ($300 million run-rate), as a function of “capital transaction” accounting.\n\n“By not counting capital transactions, we’re actually lowering profits,” Christensen explained.\n\nCritics like PaperImperium have questioned the effectiveness of management. “The cumulative cost to design, plan, and launch USDS is pretty high,” he wrote on X. “Around $44M went into it over the last few years… expenses currently run around $100m/year annually.”\n\nHe noted that, despite these incentives, USDS has not meaningfully surpassed DAI or other stablecoin competitors in market share, even in a favorable environment.\n\nBlockworks contacted the Sky team with questions but was referred to the community call.\n\nRajiv, a lead contributor to Sky’s analytics effort, offered some nuance on the community call: “It just feels like the sweet spot for sUSDS is really these large, more institutional-type holders who really value the immediate liquidity.” Crypto funds like Galaxy Digital were cited as recent stakers, even as smaller long-tail users pulled back from Sky token reward participation.\n\nEtherscan shows sUSDS, which receives the Sky savings rate (currently 4.75%), is held by a total of 4,656 wallets. That excludes some sUSDS pledged as collateral in certain DeFi smart contracts, but the figure should be fairly representative of the number of individuals or entities making use of the protocol.\n\nSource: Dune / Viridian Advisors\n\nStill, the combined USDS and DAI supply ended Q2 2025 essentially flat, with a surprising twist: DAI itself is growing again. “Over the last few weeks, there’s been a very interesting trend of an uptick in DAI demand,” Rajiv noted.\n\nThat observation underscores a broader shift: while Sky is no longer betting on transactional stablecoin PMF, it is leaning heavily into the idea of capital formation through bespoke ecosystem units like Spark and Grove. These “Stars” are expected to embed USDS as a super-senior capital layer while onboarding risk capital into higher-return strategies, Christiansen noted.\n\n“Sky is evolving from just offering a stablecoin to offering the more general value of supporting capital formation,” Christiansen said.\n\nHe cited Spark as an example: “Sky put in $25 million, and got out $390 million.”\n\nFrom brand to token\n\nAnother core milestone: the transition from MKR to SKY, now nearing completion.\n\nAs of May 2025, SKY has exclusive governance authority, with MKR holders able to convert 1:24,000. The pace of conversion spiked sharply in Q2, as shown in Blockworks Research data, following the announcement of a “Delayed Upgrade Penalty” — the planned 1% decay in the conversion ratio every three months starting on September 18.\n\nSource: Blockworks Research\n\n“It’s an important step towards eliminating fixed costs and ensuring income flows to SKY holders,” Christiansen said of the transition at the time. Sky staking is also a bright spot, enabling rewards in USDS, or compounding back into SKY via Yearn Finance liquid-staking vault.\n\nLooking ahead, Sky’s governance architecture is expected to further evolve via the “Core Council,” and staking reforms could introduce lockups and anti-LST protections. Rune framed that as a “two-year” roadmap item, part of a longer arc toward institutional-grade governance and capital structure management.\n\nSo far, the market hasn’t rewarded the protocol with breakout usage, although the architecture is in good shape.\n\n“Sky will grow as an entire economy,” Christiansen said. “More vertically integrated growth… [rather than] USDS being used everywhere for some particular specific niche.”\n\nGet the news in your inbox.

    "content": "Advertisement\n\nVolkswagen Singapore now accepts Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and more for car purchases through a partnership with licensed payment provider FOMO Pay, making it one of the latest automakers to embrace crypto transactions.\n\nThis move solidifies Volkswagen Singapore’s position as a forward-thinking automaker, catering to the growing demand for alternative payment methods.\n\nBy embracing crypto, it appeals to younger, tech-savvy buyers while offering global clients faster, more convenient transactions than traditional bank transfers.\n\nWelcoming the move, Dr. Kurt Leitner, Managing Director of Volkswagen Group Singapore, said, “An increasing number of consumers today are digital natives. They expect speed and convenience across all touchpoints, including how they pay. Our partnership with FOMO Pay aligns with our broader vision of delivering premium experiences powered by technology and innovation.”\n\nThrough FOMO Pay’s infrastructure, payments are completed in real time with safeguards against volatility and fraud. Customers simply scan a QR code, pay via their crypto wallet, and instantly finalize their purchase, eliminating banking delays while ensuring blockchain-backed transparency and traceability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin Whales’ Accumulation Skyrockets\n\nAccording to Santiment, Bitcoin whales and sharks are back in accumulation mode, having added 20,061 BTC to their holdings following last week’s all-time high. Despite a 6.22% pullback since August 13, wallets holding 10–10,000 BTC continue to stack more coins.\n\nSource: Santiment\n\nThe leading on-chain metrics provider added, “When we zoom out, this same group of key stakeholders has added 225,320 Bitcoin going back to March 22nd. There has been notable correlation between this group’s holdings and the direction of future price movement for the majority of the past five years.”\n\nAnalysts see this whale accumulation as a strong bullish signal. Large holders, often dubbed smart money, tend to buy strategically ahead of rallies. Their latest spree signals confidence, viewing last week’s dip not as weakness, but as a discounted entry into Bitcoin.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet recently added 775 BTC worth $93M, strengthening its spot as the only non-U.S. company in the top 10 corporate Bitcoin holders.\n\nThe firm, which rebranded in 2024 from a hotel and tech business, continues to double down on its Bitcoin strategy.\n\nAt the time of this writing, Bitcoin was trading at $108,565, according to CoinGecko data.",

    "description": null,
    "content": "Tron has announced its most significant fee cut since inception, slashing network fees by 60%. The proposal, supported by Tron’s super representative community, passed earlier this week and is set to take effect on August 29. Founder Justin Sun confirmed the development, calling it a bold move that sets Tron apart from most blockchain networks. Sun described the fee reduction as a “tangible benefit for users,” noting that very few networks have the willingness to make such sweeping changes. The move will impact short-term revenue. He emphasized that greater adoption and transaction growth could strengthen Tron’s profitability in the long run.\n\nBalancing Profitability and Growth\n\nJustin Sun said the move reflects a long-term vision to keep Tron competitive. Lower fees are expected to make the network more accessible for developers and everyday users. The community will track the results through quarterly reviews. Looking at factors like TRX price, network demand, and overall growth. The goal is to strike a balance between long-term sustainability and Tron commitment to accessibility. By prioritizing user adoption, Tron is betting that increased activity will offset reduced transaction revenues. If successful, the cut could solidify Tron’s position as one of the most cost-effective blockchains in the market.\n\nEnergy and Bandwidth Over Gas Fees\n\nTron has already distinguished itself with a resource model that replaces traditional gas fees. Instead of paying per transaction, users can stake TRX to access “Energy” and “Bandwidth.” Energy powers smart contract execution and complex decentralized applications, while Bandwidth covers simple operations such as token transfers or microtransactions. This model allows developers and organizations to operate at predictable costs while giving users the ability to transact freely once they have staked tokens. For individuals, the change translates into cheaper remittances and everyday payments. For businesses, it provides a scalable solution to manage large transaction volumes without constant costs.\n\nStrengthening Global Adoption\n\nWith over 300 million users, Tron has established itself as a leader in scalable and affordable blockchain services. The newly approved 60% fee cut could expand its global reach. Especially in regions where high transaction costs still limit adoption. Justin Sun called the move both a challenge and an opportunity. By prioritizing accessibility over short-term revenue. Tron is signaling strong confidence in its long-term growth strategy. For everyday users, it marks a clear step toward making blockchain activity. That is more affordable, predictable, and inclusive.",

    "title": "'Red September' Is Coming—Here's What to Expect From the Bitcoin Market",
    "description": null,
    "content": "In brief Bitcoin has dropped 3.77% on average each September since 2013, with eight monthly crashes in 11 years.\n\nSeasonal pressures—from fund rebalancing to Fed policy jitters—fuel risk-off sentiment that spills over from stocks into crypto.\n\nThis year’s setup adds war, sticky inflation, and Fed uncertainty, making $105K the line in the sand for traders.\n\nDecrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nBitcoin is trading sideways as August winds down, and crypto traders are doing what they do every year around this time: preparing for pain.\n\nThe phenomenon known as \"Red September,\" or “The September Effect,” has haunted markets for nearly a century. The S&P 500 has averaged negative returns in September since 1928, making it the index's only consistently negative month. Bitcoin's track record is worse—the cryptocurrency has fallen an average of 3.77% each September since 2013, crashing eight times according to data from Coinglass.\n\n\"The pattern is predictable: negative social media chatter spikes around August 25, followed by increased Bitcoin deposits to exchanges within 48-72 hours,\" Yuri Berg, a consultant at the Swiss-based crypto liquidity provider FinchTrade, told Decrypt.\n\n\"Red September has gone from market anomaly to monthly psychology experiment. We're watching an entire market talk itself into a selloff based on history rather than current fundamentals.\"\n\nImage: Coinglass\n\nThe mechanics behind Red September trace back to structural market behaviors that converge each fall. Mutual funds close their fiscal years in September, triggering tax-loss harvesting and portfolio rebalancing that floods markets with sell orders. Summer vacation season ends, bringing traders back to desks where they reassess positions after months of thin liquidity. Bond issuances surge post-Labor Day, pulling capital from equities and risk assets as institutions rotate into fixed income.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee holds its September meeting, creating uncertainty that freezes buying until policy direction clarifies. In crypto, these pressures compound: Bitcoin's 24/7 trading means no circuit breakers when selling accelerates, and a smaller market cap makes it vulnerable to whale movements seeking to rotate profits into altcoins.\n\n﻿\n\nThe cascade starts in traditional markets and spills into crypto within days. When the S&P 500 drops, institutional investors dump Bitcoin first to meet margin calls or reduce portfolio risk. Futures markets amplify the damage through liquidation cascades—a 5% spot move can trigger 20% in derivatives wipeouts. Social sentiment metrics turn negative by late August and traders sell preemptively to avoid expected losses. Options dealers hedge their exposure by selling spot Bitcoin as volatility rises, adding mechanical pressure regardless of fundamentals.\n\nAnd just like any other markets, some believe this becomes a pattern out of pure rational expectation, which is just another way to say self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nThe numbers back up Berg's observation. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index has dropped from 74 out of 100 to 52, despite the global stock market showing a more optimistic view with 64 points. Borderline neutral but still in the “greed” zone.\n\nImage: CNN\n\nBut this September arrives with unusual crosscurrents. The Federal Reserve has shared positive statements, with the market pricing in another cut for the September 18 meeting. Core inflation remains stuck at 3.1%, while two active wars disrupt global supply chains. These conditions create what Daniel Keller, CEO of InFlux Technologies, sees as a perfect storm.\n\n\"We have two history-defining theaters of combat, one in Europe and one in the Middle East, which are disrupting critical supply chains,\" Keller told Decrypt. \"Additionally, the U.S. has initiated a global trade war against nearly all of its major allies. The contemporary state of global geopolitics perfectly positions BTC for a steep decline come September 2025.\"\n\nIn other words, right now markets don’t see Bitcoin as a hedge, which was the dominant pre-COVID narrative of BTC as an asset. Markets view it much more like a risk asset.\n\nTechnical indicators are starting to paint a scary picture for traders. Bitcoin broke below the critical $110,000 support level that has anchored the rally since May. The 50-day moving average sits at $114,000 and is now acting as resistance with the 200-day EMA providing support near the $103K price line.\n\nTechnical traders might be watching $105,000 as the line in the sand. On Myriad, a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company Dastan, traders currently place the odds of Bitcoin dipping back down to $105,000 at nearly 75%.\n\nA break below $105K would target sub-100K levels below the 200-day moving average. Hold above $110,000 through the first two weeks of September, and the seasonal curse might finally break.\n\nThe relative strength index reads 38, in oversold territory implying at least some Bitcoin investors are trying to get rid of their coins ASAP. Volume remains 30% below July averages, typical for late-summer trading but potentially problematic if volatility spikes.\n\nBut even if things seem like traders are preparing for history to repeat itself, some believe Bitcoin’s fundamentals are now stronger than ever, and that should be enough for the king of crypto to overcome this difficult month—or at least not crash like it has in the past.\n\n\"The idea of 'Red September' is more myth than math,\" Ben Kurland, CEO at crypto research platform DYOR, told Decrypt. \"Historically, September has looked weak because of portfolio rebalancing, fading retail momentum, and macro jitters, but those patterns mattered when Bitcoin was a smaller, thinner market.\"\n\nKurland points to liquidity as the real driver now. \"Inflation isn't gliding lower, it's proving sticky with core readings still creeping higher. But even with that headwind, the Fed is under pressure to ease as growth cools, and institutional inflows are deeper than ever.\"\n\nTraditional warning signs are already flashing. The FOMC meets September 17-18, with markets split on whether officials will hold rates or cut them.\n\nKeller advises watching fear and greed indices closely. \"Traders in the coming weeks should monitor fear and greed indices to determine the general market sentiment and whether it's better to hold in case prices jump or sell off as 'Red September' looms closer,\" he said.\n\nThe seasonal pattern may be weakening as crypto matures. Bitcoin's September losses have moderated from an average negative 6% in the 2010s to negative 2.55% over the past five years. Institutional adoption through ETFs and corporate treasuries has added stability. In fact, in the last two years, Bitcoin has registered positive gains in September.\n\nBerg sees the whole phenomenon as self-reinforcing psychology. \"After years of September selloffs, the crypto community has trained itself to expect weakness. This creates a cycle where fear of the dip becomes the dip itself,\" he said.\n\nIt the outlook seems bleak, don’t fret: After Red September comes October—or “Uptober”—which is historically Bitcoin’s best month of the year.\n\nDisclaimer The views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.",

    "title": "El Salvador Bitcoin Reserve Moved $680M Amid Quantum Threats",
    "description": null,
    "content": "El Salvador has once again made headlines with its bold Bitcoin strategy. According to Coin Bureau, the country just moved its entire Bitcoin reserve—worth around $680 million—to new wallets. In total, 6,283 BTC was spread across 14 wallets, with no single wallet holding more than 500 BTC.\n\nA Bold Security Move\n\nEl Salvador was the first country to make Bitcoin legal money back in 2021. Since then, it has kept Bitcoin as part of its national savings.\n\nQuantum computing is still developing, but experts warn it could one day crack Bitcoin’s encryption. By splitting its holdings, El Salvador reduces the risk of a single wallet being compromised. The strategy shows the country is thinking ahead, not waiting for threats to become real.\n\nWhy Quantum Risks Matter\n\nToday’s Bitcoin security depends on strong cryptography. For now, that encryption remains safe from hackers. But if quantum computers advance quickly, they could break those protections.\n\nMany researchers believe this risk is years away. Still, El Salvador isn’t waiting. The government wants its Bitcoin safe not just for today, but for decades. This move sends a clear message: they view Bitcoin as a long-term asset worth protecting.\n\nSplitting the Reserve\n\nThe decision to cap each wallet at 500 BTC is a smart safeguard. If one wallet is ever hacked, the loss stays limited. The rest of the reserve remains untouched.\n\nThis approach is common in traditional finance. Banks and funds often spread money across accounts to avoid big losses. In crypto, splitting wallets has become a trusted method for large holders. El Salvador is applying the same logic on a national scale.\n\nMarket Reaction and Wider Impact\n\nSo far, the market has reacted calmly. Traders see the move as a sign of responsibility, not panic. By preparing early, El Salvador shows it takes its Bitcoin strategy seriously.\n\nSome analysts believe this could inspire other governments and institutions to recheck their own security. If one nation is already planning for quantum risks, others may follow. That could make crypto security a bigger focus in the years ahead.\n\nEl Salvador’s Bitcoin Story Continues\n\nThis isn’t the first time El Salvador has taken bold action. The government has launched the Chivo wallet, promoted Bitcoin education, and even announced plans for “Bitcoin City.” Each move pushes the country further into the global crypto spotlight.\n\nRelocating its $680 million Bitcoin reserve adds another chapter to that story. It shows El Salvador isn’t just adopting Bitcoin—it’s working to protect it against the future.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nEl Salvador’s move shows one clear thing: crypto security has to grow as technology does. By spreading its Bitcoin across several wallets, El Salvador is making it clear that it trusts Bitcoin for the long run.\n\nToday, no other country matches El Salvador’s bold approach to Bitcoin. This move shows it wants to hold on to that lead.",

The result coincided with a new all-time high for ETH and further expectations of scaling the $5,000 hurdle for the first time.\n\nEthereum activity returned to levels not seen since 2021, showing the combination of value growth and on-chain transfers. The recent ETH rally also showed that the L1 was good enough for large-scale DeFi, with no serious gas spikes or congestion.\n\nAdoption for DeFi and stablecoin usage remains near peak levels. Monthly active addresses for ETH expanded to 9.7M, with regular daily spikes to over 830K daily active users.\n\nEthereum monthly transactions and volumes reach 2025 peak\n\nEthereum monthly transactions reached over 46.9M transfers as of August 29, breaking the peak from May 2021 at 45.06M transfers. Based on those transaction levels, the Ethereum network moved over $14B on a weekly basis, returning to liquidity not seen since the summer of 2021.\n\nOn-chain volumes also reached the highest level for 2025 in the past month.\n\nETH is still facing disparate price pressures. Reports have shown whales are still buying significant amounts of ETH after the recent small dip.\n\nEthereum whale just bought $80,370,000 $ETH. Buy the dip opportunities incoming. pic.twitter.com/PGxco1CwWr — Ted (@TedPillows) August 29, 2025\n\nAt the same time, Wintermute has accumulated ETH with the potential to sell, and Binance has also placed millions of ETH orders within minutes.\n\nBased on recent reports, the market absorbed up to $400M in ETH for the past few hours. ETH may also see additional downside, as most of the liquidity is deployed below current prices. Large-scale whale selling may lead to additional liquidations, erasing some of the net gains for August.\n\nThe rise in activity is seen as a sign of retail returning. In the past quarters, retail had almost abandoned ETH, while whales continued to accumulate. Now, Ethereum activity shows a shift in sentiment, with users returning to the most active apps.\n\nBased on gas usage, the Ethereum network carries simple ETH transfers, with USDT and USDC also in the top 3 smart contracts. As a whole, smart contract creation expanded for Ethereum in 2025, again recovering to activity levels of 2021. This time around, the smart contracts were tied to DeFi, and not to NFT or the launch of meme tokens.\n\nEthereum activity boosts ETH market price\n\nAs ETH showed robust results, the price stabilized around $4,350.16, based on robust inflows. ETH recovered above 0.040 BTC, retaining its momentum while BTC showed weakness.\n\nBased on the monthly performance to date, ETH is on track to end August with a net gain for the first time in three years. For the month to date, ETH gained over 17%, despite short-term volatility and corrections.\n\nETH is also showing signs of ongoing whale accumulation, with a mix of selling at the peak and re-buying at lower prices. ETH also has an ongoing interest in ETF buying for the whole of 2025, as Cryptopolitan previously reported.\n\nThe Ethereum chain has now evolved to carry a different type of traffic, mostly removing NFT and play-to-earn games. Ethereum also showed that the network was not cannibalized by L2 chains or abandoned for cheaper L1 networks like Solana and BNB Chain. The only thing that kept users away was the lack of liquidity and DeFi opportunities.\n\nSign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",

    "content": "KEY FACTS : Dutch cryptocurrency firm Amdax has launched AMBTS B.V., a Bitcoin treasury company, with €20 million ($23.3 million) in initial funding, aiming to acquire 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply, approximately 210,000 BTC valued at over $24 billion. AMBTS plans to list on Amsterdam’s Euronext exchange, leveraging Amdax’s regulatory credentials, including a MiCA license from the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets. The initiative, backed by investors like Marc van der Chijs, seeks to capitalize on Bitcoin’s growing institutional adoption, following the lead of firms like Strategy, while offering a regulated vehicle for investors to gain Bitcoin exposure through capital market strategies aimed at increasing Bitcoin-per-share value.\n\n\n\nSources: Amdax, Bitcoin\n\nDutch Crypto Firm Amdax Launches Bitcoin Treasury with $23.3M Funding\n\nDutch cryptocurrency service provider Amdax has secured €20 million ($23.3 million) in initial funding to launch AMBTS B.V., a dedicated Bitcoin treasury company aimed at accumulating 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. The new entity, known as Amsterdam Bitcoin Treasury Strategy (AMBTS), is set to list on Amsterdam’s Euronext stock exchange, marking a significant milestone in Europe’s adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic corporate asset. This development adds to the trend of companies integrating Bitcoin into their balance sheets, following the pioneering footsteps of firms like Strategy.\n\nAMBTS is being established as an independent, privately held company with its own governance structure, designed to focus exclusively on Bitcoin accumulation and treasury management. The company’s audacious goal is to amass approximately 210,000 BTC, equivalent to 1% of the 21 million $ BTC that will ever exist due to the cryptocurrency’s fixed supply cap. At current market prices, with Bitcoin trading above $115,800, this target represents an investment of over $24 billion, highlighting the scale and ambition of Amdax’s initiative.\n\nThe $23.3 million raised in the initial financing round, which included commitments from multiple investors such as Marc van der Chijs, founder of Bitcoin miner Hut 8, will serve as a springboard for AMBTS’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The funding round, capped at €30 million ($34.8 million), is expected to close in September 2025. Proceeds will be deployed to “make a head start” on Bitcoin purchases, to boost the company’s equity value through the appreciation of its Bitcoin holdings over time. Amdax plans to raise additional capital in stages through capital markets to scale its accumulation efforts, while also aiming to increase Bitcoin-per-share metrics for its investors. Amdax stated in its announcement:\n\n“AMBTS intends to leverage the capital markets to increase its Bitcoin holdings and sequentially generate equity appreciation and grow Bitcoin per share for its shareholders, subject to market and other conditions...”\n\nThis strategy mirrors successful corporate Bitcoin treasury models, particularly in the United States, but is tailored to operate within Europe’s regulatory framework, with a listing on Euronext Amsterdam as the ultimate goal. Amdax’s launch of AMBTS positions it as a trailblazer in Europe, where institutional adoption of Bitcoin has been gaining momentum but remains less advanced than in the United States or Asia.\n\nAmdax’s regulatory credentials boost its position to execute this ambitious plan. In 2020, it became the first Dutch cryptocurrency service provider to register with the Dutch Central Bank (DNB). More recently, on June 26, 2025, Amdax secured a Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) license from the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM), ensuring compliance with Europe’s evolving regulatory framework for digital assets. Additionally, the firm has undergone stringent ISAE 3000 Type II audits, reinforcing its commitment to governance and risk management. These credentials position AMBTS to operate as a regulated and transparent vehicle for institutional investors seeking Bitcoin exposure.\n\nThe launch of AMBTS comes amid a surge in corporate Bitcoin adoption worldwide, a trend catalyzed by Strategy’s groundbreaking strategy under co-founder Michael Saylor. Strategy, the world’s largest Bitcoin treasury, currently holds 632,457 BTC, valued at over $69.5 billion, representing more than 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. The success of Strategy’s approach has inspired a wave of companies to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, reducing the amount of Bitcoin in circulation and potentially driving long-term value appreciation.\n\nBeyond Strategy, other companies have joined the Bitcoin treasury movement. In the United States, firms such as Tesla, KULR Technology, and Alliance have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Internationally, companies like Brazil’s Méliuz, Latin America’s MercadoLibre, Norway’s Aker, Malta’s Samara, Thailand’s Jasmine, and Canada’s Rumble have followed suit. In Asia, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has emerged as a leader, recently approving a plan to raise $880 million through an overseas share issuance, with $835 million allocated for Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet’s stock has surged nearly 190% year-to-date, reflecting investor enthusiasm for Bitcoin-focused strategies.\n\nIn Europe, at least 15 companies have publicly disclosed Bitcoin holdings, including Germany’s Bitcoin Group (3,605 BTC), the UK’s Smarter Web Company (2,395 BTC), France’s The Blockchain Group (1,653 BTC), and the UK’s Satsuma Technology (1,126 BTC). However, Amdax’s AMBTS stands out for its singular focus on Bitcoin accumulation and its ambition to become Europe’s first publicly listed Bitcoin treasury company.\n\nThe growing corporate interest in Bitcoin is driven by several factors, including its low correlation with traditional asset classes, resilience against inflation, and increasing mainstream adoption. Bitcoin’s price has surged nearly 32% in 2025, reaching record highs, fueled in part by regulatory victories and a supportive stance from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has branded himself the “crypto president.” These dynamics have enhanced Bitcoin’s appeal as a strategic reserve asset, particularly in times of geopolitical uncertainty and persistent inflation.\n\nAmdax’s initiative also reflects confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a store of value and a hedge against economic volatility. AMBTS, in creating a dedicated Bitcoin treasury vehicle, aims to offer institutional investors a regulated and transparent way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership. The company’s staged financing approach allows for measured growth, while its focus on increasing Bitcoin-per-share value aligns with shareholder interests.\n\nAmdax’s launch of AMBTS marks a significant step toward institutionalizing Bitcoin in Europe, offering a regulated and transparent vehicle for investors seeking exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. As the first Dutch firm to hold a MiCA license, Amdax is poised to lead the charge in integrating Bitcoin into mainstream financial portfolios. With its ambitious target of owning 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply, AMBTS could reshape the European crypto landscape, drawing parallels with Strategy’s transformative impact in the United States.\n\nInformation Sources:\n\nIf you found the article interesting or helpful, please hit the upvote button and share for visibility to other hive friends to see.
