    "content": "Google Cloud is testing its own blockchain Google Cloud Universal Ledger (GCUL) for the financial sector. This layer-1 network, developed with CME Group, aims to simplify tokenization and settlements while offering neutral infrastructure for global finance. At this stage, GCUL is running on a private testnet.\n\nRich Widmann, Google Cloud’s Head of Web3 Strategy, described the platform as “credibly neutral infrastructure” for financial institutions. Unlike blockchains developed by payment or stablecoin companies, GCUL is not tied to a single brand, making it more accessible to banks that may be reluctant to adopt a competitor’s network.\n\nOne of GCUL’s key features is support for smart contracts written in Python. Google believes this will lower the barrier for financial developers, since Python is already widely used in banking and capital markets for data analysis and automation. Full technical specifications have not yet been released, and the company has not set a timeline for a public testnet.\n\n[the source](https://thecoinomist.com/news/google-cloud-pilots-blockchain-platform-gcul/)",
