    "title": "Asia Morning Briefing: August ETF Flows Show the Massive Scale of BTC to ETH Rotation ",
    "description": "August saw $751M exit U.S. Bitcoin ETFs even as Ethereum funds pulled in nearly $4B, underscoring diverging institutional appetites as BTC stalls\n",
    "content": "Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, seeCoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.\nAugust delivered a rare reversal in the ETF tide: Bitcoin spot funds shed $751 million in net outflows just weeks after powering the asset to a $124,000 all-time high, while Ethereum ETFs quietly absorbed $3.9 billion,according to market data.\nThe divergence is striking because it marks the first time since both products launched that BTC ETFs have lost ground, while Ethereum ETFs have posted strong inflows in the same month, suggesting that institutional investors may be rebalancing their exposure.\nOn-chain data underscores Bitcoin’s fragility.A recent report from Glassnodeshows BTC slipping below the cost basis of 1- and 3-month holders, leaving short-term investors under water and raising the risk of deeper retracement. A sustained move beneath the six-month cost basis near $107,000 could accelerate losses toward the $93,000–$95,000 support zone, where a dense cluster of long-term holders last accumulated.\nPrediction markets are echoing that caution. Polymarket traders now assign a 65% chance that BTC revisits $100,000 before $130,000, while only 24% expect it to hit $150,000 by year-end. That shift suggests investors see the July rally as overextended without renewed ETF demand to back it.\nEthereum, meanwhile, has benefited from steadier inflows. ETH ETFs have logged positive net subscriptions in 10 of the last 12 months, and August’s $3.9 billion haul helped the token notch a 25% gain over 30 days despite a rough week.\nWith Bitcoin’s ETF tide flowing out, Ethereum’s steadier institutional bid may be emerging as a quiet ballast and perhaps the start of a rotation story heading into year-end.\nBTC:Market observers say crypto charts look so bearish they could be bullish, according to prior CoinDesk reporting, as BTC trades below 108k, with forced liquidations clearing leverage and a rebound likely after the Fed’s Sept. 17 decision.\nETH:Polymarket traders see Ethereum holding above $3,800 into September 5 with over 90% odds, while longer-term bets give it a 71% chance of finishing 2025 above $5,000 and slimmer odds of $10,000 or higher.\nGold:Gold climbed toward record highs as traders priced in Fed rate cuts, a weaker dollar, and political uncertainty following challenges to the central bank’s independence.\nNikkei 225:The Nikkei 225 looked set to open lower as investors weighed a U.S. court ruling against Trump’s tariffs, China-India ties, and upcoming manufacturing data.\nJustin Sun eyes ‘Swift’ for virtual asset sector, praises Hong Kong crypto moves (SCMP)\nTrump-Backed USD1 to Supplant Tether, USDC as Top Stablecoin by 2028: Blockstreet (Decrypt)\nWLFI derivatives volume jumps 400% ahead of World Liberty’s first token unlock on Monday (The Block)",

    "title": "Rich Bitcoiners Are Reportedly Spending BTC on Luxury Holidays: Does This Really Make Sense?",
    "description": "Private jet flights, yacht cruises and boutique hotels are now taking crypto. But does it make sense for bitcoin’s new wealthy to actually spend their coins? ",
    "content": "Bitcoin’s latest rally is spilling over into the luxury holiday market.\nThe Financial Times(FT)reportedearlier today that private jet firms, cruise lines and boutique hotels are increasingly accepting crypto payments.\nFlexjet-owned FXAIR, for instance, now takes tokens for transatlantic trips costing about $80,000, while cruise operator Virgin Voyages sells annual passes worth $120,000.\nSeaDream Yacht Club and boutique hotel groups including The Kessler Collection have also added crypto checkout options, according to the FT.\nHigh-end travel is a natural niche for crypto spending. On six-figure invoices, fees and volatility matter less, and merchants can instantly convert payments into fiat.\nFor customers, paying in bitcoin carries status value, echoing earlier bull-market splurges on Lamborghinis and watches. This time, the indulgence is time-saving private jets and one-of-a-kind cruises.\nStill, whether it makes financial sense is another matter. Bitcoin’s most famous cautionary tale comes from 2010, when Florida programmer Laszlo Hanyeczspent 10,000 BTC on two pizzas, a purchase now worth over $1 billion in hindsight. Today’s jet bookings could invite the same regret if bitcoin keeps climbing.\nYet others see logic in cashing in.\nWith bitcoin recently hitting a record $124,128 on Aug. 14, some wealthy holders may view the present rally as a window to lock in gains before macro shocks send prices lower.\nInflationary pressures tied to the new U.S. import tariffs, along with wider economic uncertainty, could easily knock BTC back below $100,000, turning today’s holiday splurges into a rational hedge.\nThere are also tax complications.\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service(IRS), for instance, treats crypto as property, meaning that spending BTC counts as a taxable disposal and can trigger capital-gains liabilities. The U.K.’s HMRC applies the same principle, taxing disposals when coins are sold, swapped or spent.\nThe bigger backdrop, according to McKinsey data cited by the FT, is that younger affluent travelers are driving a luxury travel boom projected to nearly double spending between 2023 and 2028. For that generation, crypto is not just an investment vehicle but also a way to pay for experiences that promise freedom and exclusivity.\nBottom line: Crypto hasn’t taken over coffee shops, but at the top end of the market it is showing up. Whether that’s smart wealth management or another billion-dollar pizza mistake depends on how long this bull cycle lasts.",

    "title": "Yen-Backed Stablecoin Can’t Come at a Better Time as BOJ Seen Raising Rates",
    "description": "Top bankers and economists expect the BOJ to hike rates in the fourth quarter, boosting the appeal of yen and yen-backed assets.",
    "content": "One of the biggest stories emerging from the Far East this month is the imminent launch of a blockchain-based version of the Japanese yen, one of the world’s major fiat currencies.\nThe timing for this development couldn’t be better, as the Bank of Japan(BOJ)is widely expected to raise interest rates soon, a move likely to increase the appeal of both the yen and yen-backed assets.\nEarlier this month,CoinDesk reported thatJapan’s Financial Services Agency(FSA)is likely to approve the country’s first yen-denominated stablecoin as early as this fall. According to the report, Tokyo-based fintech firm JPYC plans to register as a money transfer business within the month and will spearhead the rollout of a JPY-pegged stablecoin, which will trade at a 1:1 ratio with the Japanese yen.\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to an external reference, such as the U.S. dollar, euro, or yen. These tokens play a crucial role by facilitating capital transfers used for trading, investing, remittances, or international payments, all while bypassing the volatility typically associated with other cryptocurrencies.\nJPYC is not alone in pursuing a yen-pegged stablecoin. Last week, Tokyo-based financial services company Monex Groupannounced thatit is considering launching its own JPY stablecoin aimed at international remittances and corporate settlements. Oki Matsumoto, Chairman of Monex Group, told local media, “Issuing stablecoins requires significant infrastructure and capital, but if we don’t handle them, we’ll be left behind.”\nBoth leading bankers and traders expect the BOJ to hike rates in the coming months, while the U.S. Federal Reserve is seen doing the opposite.\nHiroshi Nakazawa, head of Hokuhoku Financial Group, one of Japan’s largest regional banks by assets, said over the weekend that theBOJ could raise interest ratesin either October or December, assuming “things go smoothly.”\nShares in Hokuhoku Financial Group have been the best-performing banking stocks this year, with prices rallying 90% to top the Topix banks index, which includes 70 lenders.\nNakazawa’s outlook aligns with the broader market consensus on upcoming rate hikes. According to Bloomberg Economics, the recently released Tokyo inflation report likely reinforced the BOJ’s view that consumer price momentum remains strong, on track to reach its 2% target. Theteam forecastsa 25 basis point rate hike at the BOJ’s October meeting.\nThe anticipated rate hike could prompt investors to move funds into JPY-backed stablecoins. Recall that the 2022 Fed rate hike cycle was seen as boosting demand for USD-pegged stablecoins, although the appeal of stablecoins was later temporarily dented by the Terra crash in May 2022.\nThe BOJ raised rates twice in recent years, from 0.1% to 0.25% in July last year and then another 25 basis point hike in January. Since then, the central bank has kept rates steady.\nYields on longer-duration Japanese government bonds(JGBs), the third largest government debt market after the U.S. and China, have climbed to multi-decade highs,reflecting fiscal concernsand the strong expectation of an imminent BOJ rate hike.\nFor example, the 30-year JGB yield recently surged to a record high of over 3.2%, while the 10-year yield reached 1.64%, levels not seen since 2008, according to TradingView data.\nAdding to the yen’s appeal is the narrowing gap between U.S. and Japanese 10-year yields, which has tightened to 2.62%, the lowest since August 2022. Because the USD/JPY exchange rateclosely tracksthis yield differential, a regression analysis by MacroMicro suggests the pair should trade around 144.43, compared to Friday’s level of approximately 147.00.\nIn other words, the regression analysis points to appreciation in the yen.\nThe strengthening yen and expected rate hikes also imply downside potential for BTC/JPY. The cryptocurrency pair listed on bitFlyer has already dropped 8% this month, hitting its lowest level since July 9. This recent sell-off has triggered a classic double top bearish reversal pattern on the daily chart.\nTechnical analysis using the measured move method suggests the double top breakdown could lead prices to fall to about 14,922,907 JPY. This target is calculated by subtracting the height between the two peaks and the interim trough from the trough low, indicating further downside risk for bitcoin priced in yen.",

    "title": "Major Bitcoin Breakout Could be Brewing as Retail and Institutions Stack ‘Relentlessly’",
    "description": "Bitcoin accumulation by retail and institutions is hitting highs, with one analyst saying it could set the stage for a major breakout as price steadies near $109,000",
    "content": "Bitcoin is holding steady around $108,716,according to CoinDesk Data, but behind the flat price action are signs of a potential breakout as both retail and institutions ramp up accumulation.\nOn Aug. 29, André Dragosch, European head of research at Bitwise,notedthat corporate adoption of bitcoin has accelerated at a historic pace. He said that July and August alone saw the creation of 28 new bitcoin treasury companies and an increase of more than 140,000 BTC in aggregate corporate holdings.\nThat figure is nearly equivalent to the total amount of new bitcoin mined in a year(which is around 164,000 BTC), underscoring how demand from treasuries is soaking up supply faster than it is produced.\nThe accompanying Bitwise chart showed a steep upward curve, highlighting how companies are increasingly treating bitcoin as a reserve asset in the mold of Michael Saylors' Strategy(MSTR).\nMoments later, Dragoschaddresseda popular narrative among analysts that bitcoin could “top out” in 2025 because of post-halving cycle patterns seen in earlier years. He argued that such thinking overlooks the scale of institutional demand today.\nHis chart showed that as of Aug. 29, 2025, institutional demand has absorbed over 690,000 BTC, compared with a new supply of just over 109,000 BTC, making demand roughly 6.3 times larger than supply.\nWhile Dragosch described it as nearly seven times, the precise ratio still illustrates an extraordinary imbalance that challenges historical cycle comparisons. For investors, the implication is that halving-driven supply dynamics may matter less in the current era of institutional adoption.\nTwo days earlier, on Aug. 27, Dragoschpointed toretail buying as another driver. He said the rate of accumulation across all bitcoin wallet cohorts — from small holders to whales — had reached its highest level since April. In his words, investors appear to be “stacking relentlessly.”\nThe Bitwise chart attached showed sharp upward moves across wallet groups, suggesting that retail demand is lining up with institutional flows. Historically, synchronized accumulation across cohorts has often preceded major upside moves, making the current environment notable for bulls.\nDespite the accumulation of data, bitcoin is little changed at $108,716 in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Data, as markets await clearer catalysts.\nPrice Analysis Highlights(All times are UTC)\nDisclaimer:Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence toour standards. For more information, seeCoinDesk's full AI Policy.\nAccording to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, between Aug. 30 15:00 UTC and Aug. 31 14:00 UTC, bitcoin traded in a narrow $1,285 range, peaking at $109,518.96 before retreating.\nResistance held firm near $109,500 on a volume spike of 6,077 BTC.Support formed around $108,350–$108,400, where buyers stepped in.\nA surge in volume to 8,272 BTC at 13:00 UTC pointed to institutional participation at these levels.\nIn the final hour of the analysis period, BTC broke higher from $108,340.08 to $108,398.41, with a two-phase move: consolidation around $108,260–$108,350, followed by a breakout above $108,470 resistance at 13:46 UTC.\nProfit-taking created pullbacks to the $108,320–$108,360 range, but sustained buying kept prices above $108,380 into the close.\nVolatility remains elevated after the sharp drop from $124,500 earlier in August.\nBTC is still below key $110,500 resistance, and analysts caution that a test of the $100,000 psychological level cannot be ruled out.",

    "title": "Bitcoin's Rough August Wiped Out Summer Rally; What September Might Bring",
    "description": "There's not an unlimited pool of capital available for crypto, and ether attracted the big money this month.",
    "content": "There are few things more insufferable in financial markets than seasonal indicator discussions. The grandaddy may be \"sell in May, then go away,\" which gets dragged out every spring, but probably hasn't been a valid signal since the days of Jesse Livermore, when traders literally sold in May and then headed to the beach for the summer.\nA set of seasonal indicators have developed around crypto even as the markets — just a few years old — have far too few observations for anything to be statistically valid. Among the favorites is that August tends to be rough month for prices.\nCredit where it's due, though — the seasonality fans got it right this time, at least for bitcoinBTC$107,581.13.\nDespite continuing inflows in spot ETFs, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell flipping from hawk to dove, and touching a new record high, bitcoin(with just a few hours left to go), has slipped 8% this month. At just above $108,000 bitcoin has also declined about 13% since hitting that new record above $124,000 on Aug. 13.\nThe selling has wiped out bitcoin's summer rally, the price now modestly below its Memorial Day level of $109,500.\nBitcoin's poor record this month stands in stark contrast to that of ether(ETH), which rose 14% in August, thus outperforming BTC by a whopping 2,200 basis points.\nEther's relative surge came as it attracted large amounts of capital via ETH treasury companies and the spot ETH ETFs.\nLaunched a few months after the spot BTC ETFs, the ETH funds had seen far more modest inflows than the wildly popular BTC vehicles. That's changed in a big way of late.\nThe ETH ETFs this month through Aug. 28 saw $4 billion of inflows versus just $629 million for the BTC ETFs, according to Bloomberg's James Seyffart. That alone is impressive, but when considering relative market caps — ether's $500 billion is less than 25% of BTC's $2.1 trillion — those numbers are far more mind-boggling.\nIn a world where the U.S. Fed is running a modestly tight monetary policy and fiscal policy is getting tighter thanks to higher tariffs(otherwise known as higher taxes), capital is limited. For crypto in August, at least, that capital was directed to ether, apparently at the expense of bitcoin.\nFirst the bad news: seasonality patterns suggest September tends to be even worse for bitcoin than August. In twelve Septembers going back to 2013, bitcoin has declined in eight,according to Glassnode. In the four times BTC managed an advance that month, the gains were fairly modest. All told, the average for September over the last dozen years has been negative 3.8%.\nThe good news: it's twelve Septembers and that alone is hardly a large enough sample size to pay attention to. Also, at least seven of those observations(2013-2019)were prior to bitcoin being anything more than a fringe asset and on the radar screen of only a very few investors.",

    "title": "Bitcoin or Gold: Which Is the Better Hedging Asset in 2025?",
    "description": "Bitwise’s André Dragosch argues gold still protects against stock sell-offs while bitcoin hedges bond stress — raising questions about their roles in 2025 portfolios. ",
    "content": "Given the Trump administration’s vocal and demonstrated support for crypto, some investors are likely wondering whether gold’s days as the world’s favorite hedge asset are numbered.\nAndré Dragosch, European head of research at Bitwise Asset Management, suggests the choice isn’t so simple. In apost on XSaturday, he offered a rule-of-thumb: gold still works best as protection against stock market losses, while bitcoin increasingly acts as a counterweight to bond market stress.\nThe reasoning starts with history. When equities sell off, investors oftenrush into gold. Decades of market data back this up. Gold’s long-run correlation with the S&P 500 has hovered near zero, and during market stress, it often dips into negative territory.\nFor example, in the 2022 bear market, gold prices rose about 5% even as the S&P 500 tumbled nearly 20%. That pattern illustrates why gold is still considered the classic “safe haven.”\nBitcoin, by contrast, has often struggled during equity panics. In 2022, it collapsed by more than 60% alongside tech stocks. But its relationship with U.S. Treasuries has been more intriguing.\nSeveral studiesnotethat bitcoin has shown a low or even slightly negative correlation with government bonds. That means when bond prices sink and yields rise — as they did in 2023 during fears over U.S. debt and deficits — bitcoin has sometimes held up better than gold.\nDragosch’s takeaway: investors don’t need to pick one over the other. They play different roles. Gold is still the better hedge when stocks wobble, while bitcoin may help portfolios when bond markets are under pressure from rising rates or fiscal worries.\nThe split has been clear this year.\nAs of Aug. 31, gold was up more than 30% year-to-date, according toWorld Gold Council data. That surge reflects renewed demand during bouts of equity volatility tied to tariffs, slowing growth, and political risk.\nBitcoin, meanwhile, has gained about 16.46% this year, based onCoinDesk Data, a solid performance considering that 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have fallen around 7.33%,according to MarketWatch data.\nThe S&P 500, by comparison, is up roughly 10% in 2025, perCNBC data.\nThe diverging performance underscores Dragosch’s heuristic: gold has benefited most from equity jitters, while bitcoin has held its ground as bond markets wobble under the weight of higher yields and heavy government borrowing.\nThis isn’t just Dragosch’s personal view. A Bitwiseresearch reportearlier this year noted that gold remains a reliable hedge against stock market downturns, while bitcoin has tended to provide stronger returns during recoveries and shows lower correlation with U.S. Treasuries.\nThe report concluded that holding both assets can improve diversification and optimize risk-adjusted returns.\nStill, correlations aren’t static. Bitcoin’s ties to equities strengthened in 2025 thanks to large inflows into spot ETFs, which have attracted billions from institutional investors.\nThe huge net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs make BTC trade more like a mainstream risk asset, reducing its “purity” as a bond hedge.\nShort-term shocks can also scramble the picture. Regulatory surprises, liquidity squeezes, or macro shocks may move both gold and bitcoin in the same direction, limiting their usefulness as hedges. Dragosch’s rule-of-thumb, in other words, is just that — a thesis, not a guarantee.\nTrump’s pro-crypto stance raises a provocative question: Is it time to abandon gold entirely in favor of bitcoin? Dragosch’s answer, supported by years of data, is no.\nGold still works best when stocks tumble, while bitcoin may offer shelter when bonds are under pressure. For investors, the lesson isn’t ditching one asset for the other, but recognizing that they hedge different risks — and using both may be the smarter play.",

    "title": "Crypto Charts Look 'So Broken and Bearish They’re Bullish' Ahead of Fed Meeting, Says Analyst",
    "description": "Alex Krüger says recent liquidations and scary charts could set up a bullish rebound, though conviction trends may wait until after the Fed’s Sept. 17 decision.",
    "content": "Crypto analyst and macroeconomist Alex Krüger thinks the market looks ugly enough to turn bullish.\nOn Saturday, Krüger wroteon X, that “most crypto charts now look so broken and bearish that it’s bullish.” He argued that when price action looks this bad, the panic has usually gone far enough that a reversal may not be far behind.\nKrüger attached a series of charts from Binance and derivatives dashboards.\nThey included bitcoinBTC$107,581.13and ether(ETH)spot price charts, both of which had fallen below short-term upward trendlines, creating a technically bearish picture. He also posted a solanaSOL$198.47chart that showed relative resilience compared with BTC and ETH.\nAlongside those, he shared BTC-USDT and ETH-USDT derivatives charts, which combined futures indicators — such as funding rates and long liquidations — with options metrics like skew. Together, they showed traders had turned heavily defensive.\nIn his post, Krüger said long liquidations had been “significant,” especially in “the last two rounds after the close today.”\nIn futures markets, traders can borrow to take bullish bets. When prices fall, their collateral gets wiped out and exchanges automatically close positions. This kind of forced selling pushes prices down further in a cascade. Once it’s over, however, markets can stabilize because the excess leverage has already been flushed out.\nThe analyst also highlighted that bitcoin and ether absorbed most of the selling, while many altcoins had already stopped crashing earlier in the day. Normally, smaller tokens collapse after majors, not before them.\nFor Krüger, that divergence is “often a sign of upcoming strength,” suggesting panic selling may be winding down.\nKrüger told followers to “check the skew,” noting that puts were much more expensive than calls. In options markets, that imbalance signals defensive positioning and heightened fear.\nFor contrarians like Krüger, one-sided fear often precedes a rebound, because if everyone is already hedging, there are fewer sellers left to push prices lower.\nWhile he is “bullish into next week,” Krüger said he doesn’t expect strong trends to develop until after the Federal Reserve’s next policy meeting.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC)meets Sept. 16–17, with a rate decision and press conference at the conclusion on Sept. 17.\nHe expects the Fed to cut interest rates, which he argues is “not fully priced in.”\nLower rates reduce the cost of borrowing and often add liquidity, which can boost demand for risk assets like crypto.\nKrüger emphasized that this is not the end of the cycle, even if prices fall further in the short term. At the same time, he does not expect the kind of euphoric “blow-off top” that has marked past crypto bull markets.\nThe one exception, he said, could be SOL, which continues to attract inflows from new decentralized treasuries deploying capital on the network.\nFor Krüger, the setup is straightforward: charts look ugly, liquidations are behind, options pricing screams fear, and the Fed decision looms. His message was simple — the time to bet on upside is when panic is loudest, not when celebrations begin.",

    "description": "Venture capital is consolidating into larger, higher-conviction bets, with infrastructure projects leading the way, according to Outlier Ventures",
    "content": "Web3 startups raised $9.6 billion in venture funding during the second quarter of 2025, making it the second-largest quarter on record, even as the number of deals fell to multi-year lows,according to a new report by Outlier Ventures.\nThe research by the London-based venture capital firm could present a maturing market in which investors are putting more money into fewer projects.\nThe findings suggest that Web3 fundraising is evolving from hype-driven activity toward targeted, durability-focused investment, with investors favoring foundational infrastructure and proven teams over volume.\nOnly 306 deals were disclosed in the quarter, the lowest since mid-2023, but the median deal size rose across every stage. Outlier said this reflects a shift from broad, speculative investing to strategic, high-conviction allocations.\nSeries A funding, which had slowed sharply during the bear market, staged a comeback. The median Series A round grew to $17.6 million, with 27 deals totaling $420 million, the largest since 2022. Seed funding also picked up, with a median size of $6.6 million.\nToken fundraising painted a split picture. Private token sales raised $410 million across just 15 deals—their strongest showing since 2021, while public token sales slumped 83% to $134 million, underscoring waning appetite for retail-focused offerings.\nSectors such as cryptocurrency infrastructure, mining and validation, and compute networks saw the largest rounds, with medians ranging between $70 million and $112 million. Consumer-facing sectors, such as marketplaces, trailed significantly.\n“Capital is consolidating around the projects that can provide the rails for the next phase of adoption,” Outlier wrote, adding that infrastructure-first bets are viewed as “indispensable” to Web3’s long-term growth.",

    "description": "River’s research estimates BTC ownership at 65.9% for individuals, 7.8% for funds, 6.2% for businesses and 1.5% for governments. About 7.6% is believed to be lost.",
    "content": "Riversays individuals still own the majority of bitcoin.\nThe U.S.-based bitcoin financial services firm revealed ownership distribution research dated Aug. 25 in a recentpost on X. The study groups bitcoin supply into a few categories and shows the market share of each, using public filings, custodial address tagging and earlier blockchain research.\nRiver estimates individuals control about 65.9% of circulating BTC, or 13.83 million coins. This bucket includes self-custodied wallets and exchange accounts that River classifies as individual.\nOn the institutional side, River divides holdings into businesses, ETFs and funds.\nGovernments are shown at about 1.5%, or 306,000 BTC, based on sovereign addresses tracked from public sources.\nTwo special categories round out the distribution:\nFinally, about 5.2% of the supply, or 1.09 million BTC, has yet to be mined before the hard cap of 21 million is reached.\nIn plain terms, River’s research is an attempt to map who holds bitcoin today, not to forecast future prices. The estimates are not definitive, since custodians aggregate many clients, some wallets are misclassified, and ownership can be opaque.\nRiver’s conclusion is that individuals still dominate holdings, but the institutional share is expanding, helped by the growth of ETFs and companies that now treat bitcoin as a balance-sheet asset.\nBusinesses — a global category covering corporate treasuries and conventional firms that report bitcoin holdings — account for about 6.2% of supply, or 1.30 million BTC.\nETFs and funds — spot ETFs and investment vehicles that custody coins for clients — control about 7.8%, or 1.63 million BTC.\nLost bitcoin makes up about 7.6%, or 1.58 million BTC. River says this is inferred from age heuristics, which show coins that have not moved for many years and are likely unrecoverable.\nSatoshi/Patoshi holdings are pegged at about 4.6%, or 968,000 BTC, based on earlier research into early-era mining patterns.",

    "title": "Businesses Are Absorbing Bitcoin at 4x the Rate It Is Mined, According to River’s Research",
    "description": "River’s new flow map suggests companies absorb around 1,755 BTC per day versus  approximately 450 mined, with funds and ETFs adding more demand.",
    "content": "Riversays companies are taking in far more bitcoin each day than miners create.\nThe U.S.-based bitcoin financial services firm, which runs brokerage and mining operations and publishes research, released a Sankey-style flow infographic dated Aug. 25 in apost on X. In this layout, outflows are shown on the left, inflows on the right, and the thickness of each line represents the size of the net daily movement.\nRiver defines “businesses” broadly. The category combines bitcoin treasury companies — firms such as Strategy that publicly hold BTC — with conventional companies that keep bitcoin on their balance sheets. Based on public filings, custodial address tagging and its own heuristics, River estimates that about 1,755 BTC per day flow into business-controlled wallets.\nBy comparison, River calculates new miner supply at about 450 BTC per day in 2025. That figure reflects the April 2024 halving, which cut the block subsidy to 3.125 BTC per block.\nWith bitcoin blocks averaging one every 10 minutes — about 144 per day — the result is roughly 450 BTC in new issuance daily, though the exact number fluctuates slightly as block times vary.\nThat math is the basis for River’s claim that companies are absorbing bitcoin at nearly four times the rate it is mined.\nThe infographic shows other large institutional inflows as well.\nFunds and ETFs account for about 1,430 BTC/day in net inflows, which further boosts total absorption compared with new issuance. Smaller streams go to “other” entities(about 411 BTC/day)and governments(about 39 BTC/day).\nRiver also records a small but steady flow into “lost bitcoin”(about 14 BTC/day), representing coins that the firm judges to be permanently inaccessible, such as through key loss.\nOn the other side of the ledger, individuals appear as the largest net outflow at about –3,196 BTC/day. River stresses that this does not necessarily mean retail investors are dumping coins. Rather, it reflects bitcoin moving from addresses the firm classifies as individual-held into those it tags as institutional.\nRiver says the takeaway is simple: when inflows to businesses and funds exceed new issuance from miners, available supply tightens. Still, the firm cautions that the infographic should be read carefully.\nFirst, the figures are estimates, not an exact census of the blockchain.\nRiver relies on a mix of wallet tagging, public disclosures and external databases, which may miss some holdings or misclassify certain addresses. Second, net inflows do not always equal direct spot buying. A business wallet showing +1,755 BTC per day could reflect OTC transactions, custodial transfers or treasury reshuffling, not just exchange purchases.\nFor readers unfamiliar with flow diagrams, the point is this: the lines show where coins are ending up on balance, not every trade or transfer in the system. If more coins consistently end up in business, fund and government wallets than miners are producing, River argues that institutions are tightening supply at the margin.\nRiver’s snapshot is not a price forecast, but it illustrates how ownership patterns may be shifting. If businesses and funds continue to absorb more than miners produce, the firm argues, institutions could play a larger role in shaping bitcoin’s supply dynamics.",

    "title": "Hyperliquid’s HYPE Token: Why Arthur Hayes Thinks It Has 126x Upside Potential",
    "description": "Arthur Hayes argues that fiat decline drives stablecoin saving, funneling into crypto speculation—and Hyperliquid is the exchange built for that wave.",
    "content": "Arthur Hayes, the BitMEX co-founder now serving as co-founder and chief investment officer of crypto-focused venture capital firmMaelstrom, says Hyperliquid’s HYPE token could soar more than 100-fold.\nHayes is best known for inventing the perpetual swap at BitMEX, the derivatives contract that changed crypto trading. At Maelstrom, he invests in early-stage infrastructure projects. In his latestblog post, Hayes argued Hyperliquid’s token could rise 126 times, a claim backed by a valuation model produced by Maelstrom.\nHyperliquidis a decentralized exchange built on its own blockchain. Unlike Coinbase or Binance, which are companies running private servers, Hyperliquid lives fully on-chain. Traders use it mainly for perpetual futures — contracts that let them bet on crypto prices without an expiry date.\nIts native token, HYPE, acts as both a governance tool and an economic stake. Holders can vote on upgrades, stake tokens for rewards and benefit from the way trading fees link to the token’s value. In short, Hyperliquid is the venue and HYPE is how users share in its growth.\nHayes begins his case with the big picture.\nHe says when governments print too much money, currencies lose value and ordinary savers are forced to speculate just to maintain their standard of living. Those who don’t already own houses or stocks see their savings eroded.\nFor many, especially in emerging markets, the easiest way to save today is with stablecoins such as USDT and USDC — digital dollars that sit natively on blockchains. Once you’re holding stablecoins, Hayes argues, the most obvious place to put them to work is crypto itself, since that’s the system where those tokens function most easily.\nThat funnel, according to the Maelstrom CIO, leads straight to Hyperliquid. Hayes says it already dominates decentralized perpetual futures trading, controlling around two-thirds of the market and is starting to grow against centralized giants like Binance.\nHe points to execution as the difference. He believes that Hyperliquid’s small team, led by founder Jeff Yan, ships features faster than rivals with hundreds of employees. The platform feels as fast as Binance, Hayes says, but every step — trading, settlement, collateral management — happens transparently on-chain.\nHe calls Hyperliquid a “decentralized Binance.” Like Binance, it relies on stablecoins instead of banks for deposits. Unlike Binance, everything is recorded on its blockchain. Hyperliquid’s HIP-3 upgrade also lets outside developers create entirely new markets that plug directly into its order book, turning it into a permissionless trading hub.\nThen comes the math. Maelstrom’s model starts with a bold forecast: by 2028, the total value of stablecoins could reach $10 trillion.\nNext, Hayes borrows a ratio from Binance’s history. On that exchange, daily trading volume has often equaled about 26.4% of the total stablecoin supply. Apply that ratio to $10 trillion, and Hyperliquid could see about $2.6 trillion in trades every day.\nNow add fees. Hyperliquid charges around 0.03% per trade. On $2.6 trillion in daily activity, that works out to roughly $258 billion in annual revenues once you roll it up across the year.\nInvestors then discount those future revenues into today’s money to reflect risk and the time value of money. Hayes uses a 5% rate, which produces a present value of about $5.16 trillion.\nFinally, stack that against HYPE’s current fully diluted valuation of around $41 billion. Divide the two, and you get Hayes’s headline number: a potential 126x upside.\nHe ties the calculation back to his broader thesis—that weak money forces people into stablecoins, and stablecoins push them into crypto speculation, with Hyperliquid as the rails for that activity and HYPE as the token that captures the economics.\nHayes closes out his thesis with a bold prediction. “The King is dead. Long live the King,” he wrote, arguing Hyperliquid could surpass Binance as the world’s largest exchange and that Jeff Yan could one day rival CZ’s wealth.\nThe model depends on big assumptions: a $10 trillion stablecoin market, Hyperliquid holding a Binance-level share, fees holding at 0.03% and discount rates staying low. If those conditions break, so does the outcome.\nBut Hayes’s through-line is simple. If the world saves in stablecoins, the speculation that follows will happen on-chain — and in his view, Hyperliquid is already in the lead.",

    "content": "A deluge of crypto exchange-traded funds(ETFs)could hit U.S. markets as early as this fall, potentially changing how both institutional and retail investors access the digital asset space.

The market naturally sorts out the winners from the losers, so I’m not overly concerned about there being too many crypto ETFs floating around.”\nTo Geraci, the demand for more diverse and accessible investment options is already there — and underappreciated.\n“Given the initial response to futures-based and 1940 Act-structured Solana and XRP ETFs, I believe demand for 1933 Act spot products in these crypto assets is being severely underestimated – much like we saw with spot bitcoin and ether ETFs,” he said.\nThe iShares Bitcoin Trust(IBIT), managed and issued by BlackRock, became the most successful ETF launch in the history of those vehicles, now holding nearly $85 billion worth of bitcoin on behalf of investors.\nWhile the ether ETFs initially saw much smaller demand than their bitcoin counterparts, a recent surge in interest in the Ethereum blockchain’s native token has seen inflows for the group well surpass those for bitcoin ETFs.\nEther ETFs have taken in nearly $10 billion since the start of July, which represents the bulk of total inflows of $14 billion since their launch last year, according to James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\nGeraci also anticipates strong uptake for index-based crypto ETFs, which he says will give investors and advisors “a straightforward way to gain exposure to the broader digital asset ecosystem.” For smaller, less-known tokens, he admits demand will depend heavily on the strength of each project’s fundamentals.\n“As you move further down the crypto market cap spectrum, I expect demand for spot ETFs will be more closely tied to the success of individual projects and the performance of their underlying assets — factors that are difficult to forecast at this stage,” he said.\nSeyffart agrees that the pipeline of crypto-related products is about to burst — but he’s more skeptical about how many will stick.\n“If all of those filings ultimately launch, there will undoubtedly be some closures within the next few years,” Seyffart said. He expects “decent demand for plenty of these products,” but believes expectations need to be calibrated—especially for altcoins.\n“I’m not sure that some of these longer tail altcoins will be able to have 5+ successful ETFs,” he said. “If people are gauging their success on the level of bitcoin ETFs — they will be severely disappointed. But if others are expecting all of them to fail — they will also be severely disappointed.”\nIn his view, the market is entering a test phase where issuers will throw many products at the wall to see what sticks. “These issuers are gonna launch a lot of products and try to find something that sticks,” Seyffart said. He predicts the next 12 to 18 months will see “hundreds of crypto-related ETP launches.”\nBoth analysts agree on a central point: the ETF format creates a highly competitive landscape where investor interest is the ultimate arbiter of success. While SEC approval might open the gates, it’s asset flows that will determine who stays afloat.\nIn the ETF world, product closures are a feature — not a flaw. Just like in the stock market, low demand or poor performance can lead funds to shut down. For investors, that means not every new crypto ETF will be worth betting on, even if it carries the name of a popular blockchain project.\nFor example, a Solana ETF might find buyers if the underlying token continues to attract developers and users. But five separate ETFs based on the same coin? That’s where both Seyffart and Geraci say the market will likely intervene.\n“If demand doesn’t show up, those products will close,” Seyffart said.\nBehind this boom is the broader institutional acceptance of crypto. Since the SEC approved spot bitcoin and ether ETFs last year, asset managers have rushed to file new offerings tied to SolanaSOL$198.31, XRP, dogecoinDOGE$0.2104and many others and even basket funds tracking multiple coins. These products give traditional investors a regulated way to access crypto markets without setting up wallets or managing private keys.\nBut with that access comes the responsibility to be discerning.\n“In the end, investors will decide which products make sense and which don’t,” Geraci said. “That’s how the ETF market has always worked.”\nAnd with hundreds of crypto funds potentially hitting the market soon, that decision may need to come quickly.",

    "content": "The latest news out of the Internal Revenue Services is another high-profile crypto exit, again leaving the tax agency's digital assets operation rudderless, even as newly arriving tax policies will spur a crypto filing surge.\nYou’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government.Click hereto sign up for future editions.\nTrish Walker, the chief of the IRS digital assets office exited shortly after taking over that role. As she joins two other recently departed IRS crypto officials in heading toward the private sector, the agency is left in a leadership lurch. The tax arm of the Treasury Department isn't yet saying who will take over this massively growing area of the U.S. tax system.\nThe industry has been waiting for Congress to hatch some friendlier tax provisions for crypto, but for now, it gets the policies that are on the books. This includes some newly established forms and filings, such as the 1099-DA document that potentially millions of people will be getting for the first time from their crypto brokers.\nWith a tsunami of new crypto filings expected to come from the 2025 tax year — including from taxpayers who didn't report earlier year income because of the confusion over how it should be handled — the agency's crypto experts will presumably be worth their weight in gold. But the IRS has been slashing its budget and its personnel, with more than 20,000 employees out the door after the Elon Musk-driven federal staff reductions.(Two of the recent crypto departures were part of that personnel purge.)\nThis seems to be setting the U.S. tax agency up for a crypto workload crisis, and in a time that it seems short on experienced leadership in that office. Taxes have long been a source of confusion for digital assets enthusiasts in the U.S., and if they have questions at the end of the year, they may not find a lot of customer service at the agency.\nCrypto accountants will have an interesting road ahead.\nIf you’ve got thoughts or questions on what he should discuss next week or any other feedback you’d like to share, feel free to email the real guy behind the newsletter, Nik De, atnik@coindesk.comor find him on Bluesky@nikhileshde.bsky.social.\nYou can also join the group conversation onTelegram.\nSee you next week!\nU.S. Government Starts Pushing Economic Data Onto Blockchains as 'Proof of Concept': The U.S. Department of Commerce has begun launching its economic data releases onto a long list of blockchains in an effort to incorporate the new technology into the announcement of economic trends, starting with the gross domestic product numbers.\nUnified Crypto Lobbyists: Protect Software Developers, Senate, or We're Out:Pretty much the entire crypto industry got together more than a hundred signatures to tell the U.S. Senate they can't support a market structure bill that doesn't protect software developers from legal liability.\nCrypto's U.S. Policy Aims May Pivot on Resistance from Democratic Senator Warner:The industry's worry about those developer's legal protections seems to center at the moment on the views of senior Democratic Senator Mark Warner.\nU.S. CFTC, a Top Crypto Watchdog, Is About to Shrink Commission to Only One Member:The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is probably going to be the leading U.S. regulator of crypto activity once Congress gets its major digital assets law on the books, is facing a management issue as the five-member commission declines to a single member.\nCongress remains on break and no regulatory agency held an event this week, though the lawmakers will return to session next week.\n(Decrypt)The Solana Policy Institute backed Tornado Cash developers with money to appeal convictions.\n(Politico)The recent lobbying successes for the crypto industry have incited an influence war with the more traditional side of finance as Wall Street bankers try to maintain their pull in Washington.\n(MSN)Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he'll meet very soon with 11 candidates who are being considered to replace Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell as the Trump administration continues to pressure the Fed over interest-rate disagreements.",

    "title": "Has El Salvador Made Its Bitcoin Holdings Quantum-Proof?",
    "description": "El Salvador says its bitcoin reserve is safer from quantum threats — but the reality behind the claim is less sweeping than it sounds.",
    "content": "El Salvador has overhauled how it stores the nation’s bitcoin, saying the change both strengthens security today and prepares for technological risks that could emerge in the future.\nIn anannouncementon Friday, the Bitcoin Office said the country’s entire reserve has been moved out of a single wallet and spread across many new ones. Each wallet will hold no more than 500 BTC, a limit meant to reduce the potential damage if any one of them were ever compromised.\nOfficials described the new setup as following established industry practices while also anticipating advances in quantum computing. Quantum machines, they noted, could one day break the cryptographic math that secures bitcoin, as well as everyday systems like banking, email and online communications.\nThe concern arises when coins are spent. To move bitcoin, the digital signature protecting those funds must be revealed on the blockchain. Today, that’s safe, but in theory, a future quantum computer could exploit the exposed information to calculate the private key and steal the coins before the transaction is confirmed.\nBy shifting coins into many unused wallets, El Salvador reduces the chance that its reserve is left with too many exposed keys at once. Most of its holdings remain locked behind information that cannot currently be attacked, and capping the size of each wallet means even a breach would not put the entire reserve at risk.\nThe government also admitted that its earlier setup — keeping everything in a single address for the sake of transparency — created unnecessary exposure. That address was used repeatedly, which meant its keys were visible on the blockchain almost continuously. In the new model, apublic dashboardallows anyone to track the reserve across multiple wallets, preserving accountability without repeatedly reusing the same address.\nIn plain terms, the shift is like moving money out of one giant vault and into a series of smaller safes. The locks on those safes stay hidden until they are opened, and no single safe holds too much cash.\nBeyond the quantum angle, this also lines up with basic bitcoin housekeeping. Experienced users often warn against reusing the same wallet over and over, since it weakens privacy and security. They also recommend breaking large balances into smaller chunks, which limits the fallout if something goes wrong.\nThat’s why Adam Back, one of bitcoin’s earliest pioneers and the CEO of Blockstream,praisedthe change. Writing on X, he said it’s “generally a good practice” to split funds into many pieces — called UTXOs in bitcoin jargon — rather than piling them into one place and reusing the same address.\nBack, who invented the proof-of-work system Hashcash that inspired bitcoin and was cited by Satoshi Nakamoto, didn’t weigh in on the quantum argument directly. Instead, his comment underscored that El Salvador’s new approach reflects principles long recognized as best practice in the bitcoin world.\nMost researchers believe quantum computers powerful enough to threaten bitcoin are still a decade or more away, and the network could eventually adopt new protections if needed. But El Salvador is not waiting.\nBy combining transparency with a more resilient storage model, the country has positioned itself as a test case for how sovereign bitcoin reserves might be managed in the future — setting out a potential blueprint that others could follow.",

    "title": "‘Crypto’s Flash Boys’: A Q&A With Austin Federa on DoubleZero",
    "description": "DoubleZero was first announced in December 2024 as a blockchain layer intended to be faster than the internet. Since then, nearly 12.5% of SOL staked is operating on the DoubleZero testnet. ",
    "content": "As blockchain ecosystems mature, the speed and efficiency of the infrastructure for nodes have become more than just technical considerations —they're strategic imperatives. Leading the charge in this space is Austin Federa, former Head of Strategy at the Solana Foundation, who isgearing up to launch DoubleZero, a protocol designed to redefine how blockchains communicate and scale.\nIn a wide-ranging conversation with CoinDesk, Federa delved into the motivations behind DoubleZero, the challenges it addresses and that may come out of it, and why its vision for a high-performance networking layer could be the foundation for the next generation of decentralized systems.\nDoubleZero was first announced in December 2024 as a blockchain layer aimed to be faster than the internet and therefore crucial for crypto trades. Since then nearly 12.57% of SOL staked is operating on the DoubleZero testnet. The mainnet launch is expected to happen sometime in September.\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\nCoinDesk: Explain how DoubleZero works to someone who is new to crypto.\nAustin Federa: I think one of the easiest ways to explain what we're building is we're building crypto’s version ofFlash Boys.\nThat really was this transformational moment where people kind of realized that your edge in execution on a centralized trading venue, was no longer your actual trade logic or the speed of the computer that you have hooked up to the market, it is how quickly you can get data between different points where market events occur. That was kind of a really big change in the industry, because transit time was not [previously] considered to be terribly important.\nYou can go back and watch Formula 1 races from the 80s, they're just taking a cigarette break during a pit stop, and then someone realized “oh man, we're actually leaving a lot of time on the track by these pit stops not being optimized.” And it really is something quite similar in the trading space.\nSo for crypto, the idea of using something that's faster than the public internet(that you can use a network that you can use technologies on that are not available on the public internet), it's not necessarily a new idea. The problem was, until DoubleZero came along, it would have to have been run by one centralized company and not allow for multiple independent contributors.\nThe main technology, philosophy and economic unlock of the DoubleZero protocol is that it allows multiple contributors that have their own fiber networks to contribute portions or all of that fiber network to the DoubleZero network. It builds a giant, extremely high performance fiber mesh network that connects people all around the world.\nCoinDesk: Why build for Solana?\nFedera: We're not actually built on Solana. We do have a separate ledger system, but it's not a network that anyone ever deploys a smart contract to, it really is just an accounting database.\nThe reason that we're supporting Solana first…is because Solana is pretty unique. If you look at fast blockchains, and then you look at node count, there's a ratio of transactions per second to number of nodes, no one comes even close to Solana.\nAny network that is anywhere near the performance of Solana has a 1/5th to a 1/10th of the number of actual nodes. And so the communications problem is an exponential problem. The more nodes you have in the system, and the more places you need to get data to go, the more bandwidth you need, the more the communication becomes a bottleneck.\nSo the bigger and the faster you get a blockchain network, the more communication becomes a bottleneck for that network moving quickly. And so the real goal behind what we're doing is to allow blockchains to go faster than the public internet, without having to drop node count or add centralization.\nWe think DoubleZero has a lot more applications than just Solana, and a lot more applications than just blockchain. But it is the place where there's the biggest need at the moment. You look at the other blockchains out there, and they just don't have these problems yet.\nCoinDesk: How does staking on Solana tie to DoubleZero?\nFedera: Wehave a stake pool thatis staking to nodes on DoubleZero. As a percentage of stake, it's quite small, it's about 3 million SOL,(there's 500 million SOL), so it's not a huge amount of SOL. That was originally conceived of as a way to help subsidize the cost of validators running on our testnet, but turned out people were just very interested in running on testnet, and so that's been a really nice tool for getting more people on board with the network.\nWhen we launch mainnet data in September, that's going to be over 50 different fiber links right now. Currently its at eight. Many of the links will be 10 times faster than the connections that we have today in terms of their capacity. So going from 10 gigabit to 200 gigabit connections.\nWe see a future where, when you get enough stake operating on the DoubleZero network, protocol designers at Solana are now able to jack up limits way higher than they can on the public internet, because there's more capacity offered on DoubleZero than is available to validators operating on the public internet today, and it's a lower latency connection. So the data transmission actually, not only can you send more data, but that data arrives more quickly than it would otherwise.\nCoinDesk: So in your world there are two scenarios here: you have the public internet, or you have something like a DoubleZero. If you want to get something done faster, quicker, or other benefits for your trade, you go the DoubleZero route. Does that then create a performance inequality between validators on Solana?\nFedera: We get a version of this [question] a lot. And the question to ask yourself is, is the internet a centralizing force? The internet is basically just 20 companies that have most of the connectivity. And today if all of the OECD countries suddenly said, “no more crypto,” basically everything but bitcoin is hosed.\nSo when we're honest about what we're feeling about here, the importance is not to get rid of the internet entirely. It is to make sure the internet is there as a fallback, as a censorship resistance path. And so if DoubleZero is offline, or if there is a bad actor in the DoubleZero network that decides to try and censor blocks or something along with censored data moving through it, two things will happen:\nOne, this is why we have nine independent contributors on the network, so data will just route around them, and we can basically kick a contributor off the network. And the second thing is, we always have the public internet to fall back on. Now that may require Solana dropping from 500,000 transactions per second to 10,000 transactions per second. But that's not a bad failback state.\nThat's kind of your classic, “there's a traffic jam on the highway, I'll take the county road at the moment.”\nCoinDesk: So mainnet is coming very soon. What's happening between now and then?\nFedera: It's a lot of testing, it's a lot of making sure that we're fully ready to go. And then it's obviously a token-based project. So there is a token launch that will go along with that as well, also in the month of September.\nRead more:DoubleZero's 'New Internet' for Blockchains Nabs $400M Valuation from Top Crypto VCs",

    "description": "Despite a cooling crypto market, Pump.fun’s aggressive strategy of deploying platform revenue to repurchase its native token has driven a 17% weekly gain.",
    "content": "Pump.fun’s native token, PUMP, has bucked the market-wide downturn this week, rising by 17% as the protocol leverages platform fees to repurchase tokens.\nThe buybacks are designed to support holders by reducing circulating supply and absorbing sell pressure, a model increasingly common across crypto projects.\nAt the time of publishing, PUMP is trading at $0.0035, about 40% higher than a month ago but still down 50% from its July debut, when it quickly fell from $0.007 to $0.0024 in just 10 days.\nThe sharp post-launch decline reflected the fading of initial hype, but recent momentum suggests buybacks are helping stabilize the token’s market.\nThe driver is Pump.fun’s revenue engine. The platform earns fees on every token created through its service, a model that hasgenerated $734 million over the past year, with volumes peaking in January during the boom in celebrity-driven meme coins like TRUMP and MELANIA, along with thousands of copycat tokens that followed.\nSince inception, more than 12.5 million tokens have been launched and 23 million wallets have interacted with the site, establishing a strong user base.\nThose flows have translated into meaningful token support: Pump.fun has directed $59 million toward buybacks, according toDune dashboards, helping to underpin PUMP’s rebound.\nThe timing could be fortuitous. Autumn has historically been a stronger season for digital assets after the summer lull, suggesting conditions could align for further upside.\nStill, PUMP remains far from its launch highs, and its trajectory will depend on whether fee revenue can remain consistent in a slowing market.\nMeanwhile, the majors remain under pressure: bitcoin is trading at $108,500 and ether at $4,337, both down between 6% and 7% this week.",

With VivoPower and now Everything Blockchain, public companies are validating that XRPFi is not just a concept but an emerging institutional standard,” he added.\nEBZT framed its decision as part of a broader shift in how public companies treat blockchain assets.\n“This is about unlocking the true financial utility of digital assets like XRP, not just as speculative holdings, but as yield-bearing instruments that can compound over time,” said Arthur Rozenberg, the company’s CEO. “Flare gives us the rails to do this in a way that meets the governance, security, and auditability standards required of public companies.”\nFor now, the XRPFi push remains small in dollar terms relative to bitcoin or ether-based treasury pilots.\nBut two listed companies publicly adopting the model in under a year gives XRP a new narrative: less about speculation, more about yield, and potentially a step toward more mainstream corporate balance sheets.",

    "content": "Hedera’s HBAR token endured a sharp selloff over the past 24 hours, falling 5% from $0.24 to $0.23 as traders unloaded positions in heavy volumes. The steepest decline came early Wednesday, when more than 277 million tokens changed hands between 06:00 and 09:00 UTC, forcing prices through the $0.235 support level and briefly dragging the token to lows near $0.226. Buyers stepped in at those levels, helping HBAR stabilize, though attempts to retake $0.235–$0.241 met firm resistance.\nThe pressure intensified again later in the session, with a one-hour drop from $0.229 to $0.226 marked by concentrated selling. Trading activity spiked at 13:30 and again just after 14:00 UTC, pushing the token as low as $0.2245 before a modest rebound. That bounce stalled at $0.227–$0.229, leaving HBAR pinned just above newly established support at $0.225.\nThe turbulence comes amid a significant regulatory development in the U.S. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC)this week issued new guidance allowing U.S. traders access to offshore crypto markets via its Foreign Board of Trade advisory. Analysts suggest the move could open fresh liquidity pipelines for digital assets, including mid-cap tokens like HBAR, at a time when institutional flows are increasingly targeting undervalued corners of decentralized finance.\nFor now, however, the technical picture remains fragile. HBAR is holding above the $0.226 support area but faces stiff resistance on any rally attempts.

    "title": " Ethereum Foundation Targets Interoperability as Top UX Priority",
    "description": "The initiative marks a strategic pivot: after years spent scaling throughput and lowering costs, the protocol team is now zeroing in on interoperability as the key to user experience.\n",
    "content": "The Ethereum Foundation shareda new blog poston Friday detailing a major initiative aimed at breaking down the barriers between Ethereum’s growing constellation of Layer-2 networks.\nThe initiative marks a strategic pivot: after years spent scaling throughput and lowering costs, the protocol team is now zeroing in on interoperability as the key to user experience.\n“We see interoperability, and related projects presented in this note, as the highest leverage opportunity within the broader UX domain over the next 6-12 months, in our position as a public, core Ethereum R&D group,” the teamwrote in the blog post.\nAt its core, the update zeroes in on three goals: interoperability, speed, and finality. The most immediate push comes from the Improve UX roadmap, which builds on earlier work to scale Ethereum’s base layer and its data availability solutions. Now, developers are turning their attention toward making the network feel faster, simpler, and more unified—especially across the sprawling landscape of Layer-2 rollups.\nThe heart of the effort lies in the planned Ethereum Interoperability Layer(EIL), a trustless, censorship-resistant messaging system designed to make cross-chain interactions “feel like single-chain execution,” according to the foundation. A public design document is slated for release in October, setting the stage for a standard approach to bridging assets and data across rollups.\nComplementing EIL is theOpen Intents Framework, a shared infrastructure for “intents,” a feature where a user-declared goals like moving funds or trading assets,can abstract away the fragmented toolingthat forces developers to stitch together custom bridges and relayers. The framework was first introduced by ecosystem developers in February 2025 and gained popularity among some of the most well-known Ethereum projects. The goal: a unified UX across chains where users don’t need to care which network they’re on.\nAt the same time, Standards work is moving in tandem, with proposals such as ERC-7828 and ERC-7683 aimed at harmonizing wallet behavior and transaction flows across rollups. Together, these efforts point toward an Ethereum where applications can span multiple chains without sacrificing security or composability.\nSpeed improvements are also on the roadmap, with a Fast L1 Confirmation Rule expected by early 2026 to bring Ethereum confirmation times down to 15–30 seconds. Faster Layer-2 settlement and research into halving block times from 12 seconds to six could further reduce latency for cross-chain interactions.\nThe implications of these improvements are significant not just for rolllups but also for applications and DeFi. If developers succeed in making rollups feel like one network, liquidity and capital efficiency could surge, unlocking new kinds of products without the friction and risk of today’s bridging solutions.\nRead more:Ethereum Developers Release New Initiative to Simplify Cross-Chain Transactions",

    "description": "Your day-ahead look for Aug. 29, 2025",
    "content": "Crypto Daybook Americas will not be published on Monday due to the Labor Day holiday. It will return on Tuesday.\nBy Omkar Godbole(All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\nBitcoinBTC$107,581.13has dropped nearly 3% to $109,800 in the past 24 hours, pulling the broader market, including ether(ETH), down with it. But those losses are nothing out of the ordinary, meaning major tokens are trading near recent valuations.\nWhat's new today is that BTC's volatility is bouncing from recent multiyear lows(See Chart of the Day). The 30-day implied volatility, as represented by Volmex's BVIV and Deribit's DVOL indices, has surged above the 100-day simple moving average for the first time since mid-June. Perhaps the price turbulence that some traders predicted for August may unfold in September.\nThe increase could be noteworthy for stock traders as an early indicator of a potential uptick in Wall Street’s VIX. The VIX is inversely correlated with stocks, suggesting there's of a rough day ahead on Wall Street, a possibility underlined by fiat liquidity dynamics.\n\"Market liquidity pressures are mounting as reserve balances decline and large Treasury settlements approach, leaving equities vulnerable despite lower volatility,\" Michael Kramer, the founder of Mott Capital Management, wrote in the latest edition of the firm'smarkets update.\nOne piece of data to keep an eye on is the U.S. core PCE release, due later today.\n\"This PCE release will shape the Fed’s future easing path rather than the September decision itself,\" analysts from crypto exchange Bitunix wrote in an email. \"If data comes in at or below expectations, risk sentiment can hold; but if significantly hotter, the Fed’s forward guidance may shift toward a 'one-and-wait' stance. Investors should focus on core services and wage trends, alongside U.S. Treasury yields and the DXY as key drivers of risk appetite.\"\nIn the event of a soft CPI, ether may outperform because traders have been increasingly focusing on Ethereum's native token. That's evident from the ETF flows. This week, the U.S.-listed ETH ETFs have registered a net inflow of over $1 billion, SoSoValue data show. That's close to double the $567 million entering the bitcoin ETFs.\nIn traditional markets, the spread between the U.S. 10- and two-year Treasury yields has risen to the highest since September 2022. The so-called curve steepeningsupports the bullish casein gold and bitcoin.

By the way, I give the same credit to the Middle East. I mean, the Middle East has really embraced cryptocurrency in a massive way, and they are running and they are running fast in that endeavor,” the son of U.S. President Donald Trump said.\nTrump framed the U.S.–China dynamic as central to the future of digital finance, agreeing that both countries “are definitely leading the way on cryptocurrency.”\nAsked whether the topic might come up in anexpected trade meetingbetween his father and Chinese President Xi Jinping, he suggested the agenda would likely focus on larger issues, but said he “would certainly love to talk about bitcoin.”\nHe also emphasized bitcoin’s role in creating a uniquely international community, calling it “one of the most diverse communities in the world\" and noted that conversations about bitcoin bring together people from “different cultures, different societies, different languages, different religions.” This global network makes the asset class “great for humanity,” he said.\nHe positioned the U.S. under his father’s leadership as a fast mover, claiming that more progress on digital assets had been made in the seven months since Trump’s return to office than in the previous decade.\nTrump described America as “winning the digital revolution” thanks to strong political backing and an influx of institutional support from Wall Street firms, sovereign wealth funds, and retirement accounts.\nElsewhere in Trump cryptoland,CoinDesk recently reportedthat American Bitcoin, a miner 20% owned by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and 80% by Hut 8, is planning a September Nasdaq debut through its merger with Gryphon after raising $220 million to expand its bitcoin holdings and infrastructure.",

    "description": "Block flows suggest that traders are still betting on a year-end rally.",
    "content": "This is a daily analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.\nA key technical indicator is warning of an early end to the bitcoinBTC$107,581.13bull market, even as traders continue to position for a continued rally into the year-end.\nThe indicator under consideration is the Relative Strength Index(RSI), a momentum oscillator that ranges from 0 to 100. It helps traders gauge the speed and magnitude of recent price movements, typically calculated over a 14-day, 14-week, or 14-month period.\nBTC’s 14-month RSI is now flashing a bearish divergence, a pattern that occurs when the indicator begins to decline while prices continue to rise. The occurrence of this divergence on the monthly chart indicates that BTC's bull market may be weakening and could potentially transition into a bearish trend.\nThe monthly chart shows that while BTC reached a new high in the July-August period, surpassing the December peak, the RSI moved in the opposite direction, forming a lower high.\nThe bearish divergence gains added significance as it coincides with BTC encountering resistance at a key trendline drawn from the previous bull market peaks of December 2017 and November 2021.\nTo cut to the chase, bulls should stay alert for potential bearish trend reversals. That said, the latest market flows suggest that traders are anticipating continued price gains.\n\"Blocks suggest traders are gearing up for further gains, with notable activity in December BTC call spreads($125K/$160K). Ethereum's focus was on tighter topside, with $4,800 strikes active for September, and front-end pressure lifting,\" Jake Ostrovskis, OTC Trader at Wintermute, said in an email Thursday.\nBlock flows are large transactions privately negotiated over the counter and outside of the public order book. These transactions typically involve institutions and high-net-worth individuals.\nThe December call spread mentioned by Ostrovskis essentially bets on prices rallying to $160K and higher by the end of the year. The consensus is for a continued rally into the year-end and beyond, with prices reachingas high as $190,000. As of writing, BTC changed hands near $110,500, representing a 4.6% loss for the month, according to CoinDesk data.\nRead more:Bitcoin ‘Short Strangle’ Preferred as Market Signals Near-Term Calm: 10x Research",

    "description": "10x Research prefers the short strangle strategy for the second month as market dynamics point to near-term calm. ",
    "content": "BitcoinBTC$107,581.13defied expectations for significant volatility in August, trading within a range. As market dynamics indicate a continued low-volatility regime in the near term,10x Researchhighlights the \"short strangle\" as an ideal play.\n\"Given the current dynamics in the bitcoin options market, a short strangle looks well-suited for the next month. With bitcoin trading around $113,000 and an expected range between $95,000 and $125,000, selling an out-of-the-money [September expiry] put near $95,000 alongside an out-of-the-money [September expiry] call near $125,000 provides an opportunity to capture premium,\" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a report to clients Thursday.\nShort strangle involves a simultaneous writing(selling)of out-of-the-money higher strike calls and OTM lower strike puts with the same expiry, positioned equidistant from the underlying asset's spot price.\nThe strategy is similar to selling insurance against both bullish and bearish moves in exchange for a premium, which represents the maximum profit achievable if the spot price remains between the two strike prices - $95,000 and $125,000 in this case.\nSelling options(or strangles)is a common strategy when implied volatility(IV)exceeds realized volatility, as this allows traders to capture richer premiums, and the market is expected to remain relatively stable.\n\"The strategy works because the implied volatility curve is trading above realized levels, signaling options are overpriced, and the market is unlikely to deliver large moves outside your defined range in the short run,\" Thielen noted. \"The options implied volatility term structure indicates near-term calm.\"\nThe implied volatility(IV)term structure is a graphical representation showing how volatility is expected to evolve across different future time horizons. It is typically upward sloping, reflecting increasing uncertainty and risk as the time to expiration lengthens.\nBTC needs to continue trading between $95,000 and $125,000 for the suggested strategy to generate profits. The rangebound trading will reduce the demand for OTM calls and puts, thereby draining premium from these options and generating a profit for strangle sellers.\nThielen’s previous recommendation from early August was also a short strangle, involving a $105,000 put and a $130,000 call. This strategy generated a yield of 3.5%.\nNote, however, that short strangles carry significant risks, particularly in the event of a sudden spike in volatility, which can lead to substantial losses. Therefore, traders must continuously monitor the position and relevant market variables to manage risk effectively.\nRead more:Bitcoin Headed to $190K on Institutional Wave, Research Firm Says",

The M2 money supply exceeding $90 trillion, ETF and corporate accumulation now accounting for 6% of bitcoin’s supply, and a regulatory green light that has opened U.S. retirement accounts to crypto.\nTrump’s executive order allowing 401(k)exposure adds what Tiger calls “a definitive signal of bitcoin’s transition to a core institutional holding.” Even a 1% allocation from the $8.9 trillion pool would equal nearly $90 billion of demand.\nAccumulation is visible. ETFs collectively hold 1.3 million BTC, while Strategy(MSTR)owns more than 629,000 coins, worth $71 billion. Buying through convertible bonds has given Strategy’s flows a structural quality. Transfer volumes also skew larger, with fewer transactions but bigger sizes, reflecting a pivot from retail traffic to institutional block activity.\nStill, the report admits the network looks unbalanced. Daily transactions and active users remain well below last year’s highs, and retail participation has faded. New initiatives like BTCFi are needed to re-ignite activity beyond institutional wallets.\nOn-chain gauges also flash caution. MVRV-Z, which tracks how far market price has stretched above what holders originally paid, sits at 2.49 — a zone that in past cycles has preceded corrections as profits build up.\nAdjusted spent output profit ratio(ASOPR)is at 1.019, meaning coins being sold are only slightly in profit, suggesting traders are locking in modest gains rather than cashing out at extremes.\nNet Unrealized Profit/Loss(NUPL), a measure of unrealized profit and loss across the network, stands at 0.558, indicating a healthy but not yet euphoric positioning. Taken together, the data suggest a market that’s hot but not yet overexposed.\nRead more:Public Token Treasuries and Tokenization are Fantastic for Crypto, But Risks Remain, Binance's CZ Says",

    "description": "Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is accelerating, bringing stablecoins, treasury bills, real estate and more into the crypto ecosystem, CZ added.",
    "content": "HONG KONG — Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao believes the convergence of equity markets and crypto is ushering in a new era for digital assets, one that expands access to institutional capital and broadens crypto’s global reach.\nBut he cautions that the sector still faces significant risks, especially as it enters its first major bull cycle since these structures gained traction.\nSpeaking at Bitcoin Asia in Hong Kong, CZ said moves by public companies to hold bitcoinBTC$107,581.13and other cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets — following the example set by MicroStrategy — mark a breakthrough moment.\n“In the world’s largest economy, 90%-95% of the money is managed by institutions,” he noted. “Until ETFs and treasury companies, those guys couldn’t participate in crypto in a large way.”\nBy bringing crypto exposure to equity markets in the U.S., Hong Kong, Japan and beyond, CZ said the industry is effectively “bringing the equity markets to crypto, or bringing crypto to them — depending how you look at it.”\nBeyond bitcoin treasuries and ETFs, Zhao pointed to the surge in tokenization of real-world assets(RWAs)as another transformative trend. Stablecoins, treasury bills, commodities, real estate and even personal income streams are being tokenized, funneling “hundreds of millions and billions” into the crypto economy.\n“We’re going both ways,” CZ said. “Equity markets now have access to crypto, and we’re bringing real-world assets into crypto. This is fantastic.”\nDespite his enthusiasm, CZ warned that not every company pursuing this strategy will succeed.\nSome firms may use crypto treasuries as a way to “pump up their stock price,” while others lack the expertise to manage complex baskets of digital assets or investments in crypto startups. Failures are inevitable, he said, especially when markets turn.\n“Right now we’re in a bull market,” Zhao said. “But eventually there will be a winter, there will be a bear market. Treasury companies will have to go through at least one cycle.”\nMicroStrategy(MSTR), he noted, endured a painful first cycle but benefited later as its average bitcoin cost basis dropped.\nCZ argued that in the long run, larger inflows of capital from institutional and equity markets should reduce volatility.\n“Basically, the larger the market cap, the less volatility it has,” he said. “It’s just physics. A bigger ship is more stable.”\nBut he acknowledged that equity markets are full of speculative traders, meaning short-term volatility could increase even as the overall asset class stabilizes over time.\nWhile bitcoin remains the centerpiece of most treasury strategies, CZ noted that other tokens are being adopted too — including a recently launched BNB treasury company.\nFor smaller and newer tokens, however, the risks are magnified. “The more mature the ecosystem, the less risk,” Zhao said. “Newer ones may have higher risk and higher returns, but the established ones are safer bets.”re\nFor CZ, the fusion of crypto with traditional markets — through bitcoin treasuries, ETFs and tokenized RWAs — is overwhelmingly positive. Still, he urged caution.\n“Not every treasury company is going to multiply in value,” he said. “Investors need to evaluate them carefully, understand the risks, and be prepared for cycles.”\nRead more:Bitcoin Remains Under Pressure as Gold Quietly Targets New Record High",

    "content": "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission — under its ongoing \"crypto sprint\" to open a wider path for U.S. crypto business —issued an advisory on Thursdaythat firms residing outside the U.S. that are willing to register with the agency as foreign boards of trade can deal directly with U.S. customers.\n\"American companies that were forced to set up shop in foreign jurisdictions to facilitate crypto asset trading now have a path back to U.S. markets,\" said CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline Pham in a statement with the advisory, which didn't make any changes to agency policy but was meant to serve as a \"reminder\" of a possible approach for such companies.\n\"Since the 1990s, Americans have been able to trade on non-U.S. exchanges that are registered with the CFTC as FBOTs. Starting now, the CFTC welcomes back Americans that want to trade efficiently and safely under CFTC regulations, and opens up U.S. markets to the rest of the world,\" said Pham, who is holding the regulator's leadership spot until a permanent replacement selected by President Donald Trump can be confirmed by the Senate.\nShe called the advisory, which was issued by the CFTC’s Division of Market Oversight, \"another example of how the CFTC will continue to deliver wins for President Trump as part of our crypto sprint.”\nThe agency has been receiving increased interest insuch registrations, the statement said, and the CFTC aims to make clear that firms eligible for FBOT status don't have to register as U.S. designated contract markets(DCMs)in order to let U.S. clients directly access their electronic trading services. The firms do have to be rigorously regulated on their home turf, according to the CFTC regulations.\nTrump had nominated Brian Quintenz, a former CFTC commissioner, to take over the chairman spot, but the White Housepaused his confirmation processbefore the Senate's summer recess. He's expected to return to that process as soon as next week, but if he's confirmed, he'll be the only member of what's meant to be a five-person commission. Republican Pham has said she's set to leave, and the commission's only Democrat, Kristin Johnson, is exiting next week.\nMeanwhile, Pham has been using much of her time atop the commission to pursue crypto-friendly initiatives.\nRead More:While CFTC Awaits New Chairman, Acting Chief Pham Gets Rolling on Crypto",

Once completed, the existing shareholders are expected to retain ownership of about 98% of the combined company.\nAmerican Bitcoin launched in March with a strategy to build up bitcoin reserves both by mining the asset and buying it outright for its balance sheet. The involvement of Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump ties the company to one of the most prominent political families in the United States.\nThe announcement comes days after another Trump-linked company, Trump Media and Technology Group(DJT)said it planned to form a joint venture with Crypto.com that willgo public by combining with a special purpose acquisition vehicle(SPAC).\nAmerican Bitcoin recentlyraised $220 millionfrom accredited investors along with $10 million worth of bitcoin contributed in lieu of cash. The capital was intended to expand its infrastructure and strengthen its treasury as it moves toward life as a publicly traded firm.\nGenoot, speaking at the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong, said the miner may also take stakes in businesses outside the U.S. to broaden access to bitcoin-linked securities. Some investors are unable to buy Nasdaq-listed stocks directly, and Genoot suggested foreign partnerships could provide a pathway to exposure through regulated entities.\nFor American Bitcoin, the planned listing represents a bet that public markets remain hungry for direct exposure to crypto miners even as competition intensifies and energy costs fluctuate. A September debut would place the firm among a small cohort of miners pursuing listings as a way to draw institutional investors.\nThe move also offers Toronto-based Hut 8 another lever in its push to establish itself as a leading North American mining company, while giving the Trump brothers a foothold in a business tied directly to the growth of bitcoin.\nShares of Hut 8 were recently trading 0.6% higher at $26.5.",

The perks of doing so are substantial. Settling asset trades on-chain is nearly instantaneous; anyone, anywhere can participate(if the issuer allows it), and transactions are transparent, making them easier to track and automate.\nToday, nearly $300 billion in tokenized assets are on-chain. Boston Consulting Grouppredictsthe market will reach $600 billion by the end of the year and $19 trillion by 2030. Recent RWA deployments are showcasing blockchains’ potential to transform traditional markets.\nIn bridging traditional assets and on-chain use, blockchains act as marketplaces, with typical “chicken and egg” dynamics. Namely, issuers want to go where the active users are, and users flock to the site of the new and best products.\nEthereum was the natural starting point. Stablecoins like USDC and USDT first launched there, giving Ethereum the deepest pool of tokenized dollars and the majority of today’s on-chain RWA value.\nSolana is a top contender for RWA activity, and recent launches showcase blockchains’ potential to swiftly transform traditional markets. Kamino Finance, Solana’s leading borrowing and lending application, enables users to easily borrow against their holdings in xStocks, tokenized stocks of Apple, Tesla, and other companies. Since xStocks launched across blockchains on June 30, Solana has accounted for an average of approximately93% of daily trading volume.\nOn-chain stock token volume by blockchain | Source:Dune Analytics\nSolana’s dominance in global developer activity and active users(more than double that of the next chain)gives it an edge in courting asset issuers, while successfully onboarding them and unveiling new on-chain products will reinforce this activity.\nMore broadly, DeFi continues to grow, with greater diversity in on-chain products and institutional-grade offerings. Catering to sophisticated portfolios, builders work on products that integrate stablecoins, RWAs, and / or yield mechanics to create appeal to different risk preferences.\nEthereum currently leads the sector, with over$94 billion in total value locked(TVL)and thousands of protocols. While retaining the industry’s deepest liquidity is an advantage, there’s more to DeFi than TVL.\nThe Solana DeFi protocol's total value locked(TVL)recently surpassed approximately $10 billion. In a sign that the TVL reflects real and valuable use, Solana’s applications collectively earn more on-chain fee revenue than all other chains combined. Thanks to its speed and low costs, solana has established itself as DeFi’s active trading hub and consistently leads ether in decentralized exchange(DEX)trading volumes.\nBeyond bitcoin’s crypto role as “digital gold,” both the Ethereum and Solana blockchains have emerged as core digital infrastructure, each with distinct advantages.\nEthereum is the original open computer, where builders first coded decentralized applications and foundational institutional projects launched.\nSolana’s DeFi momentum is building. It’s the most used chain in the world already, and a hotbed for innovative DeFi products. Like Ethereum’s native ETH token, Solana’s SOL offers broad exposure to the ecosystem, meaning investors don’t need to pick individual application winners; instead, they can participate in the overall growth.\nEthereum and Solana’s long-term success depends on their being home to applications that deliver real value and, ultimately, disrupt legacy financial systems. If they can pull that off, then today’s prices may look like attractive entry points.\n-Samantha Bohbot, partner and chief growth officer, RockawayX\nQ. One year into the institutional investments in the crypto ETFs trend, how are Canadian banks and pension funds approaching bitcoin?\nA.This quarter's 13F filings reveal that Montreal-based Trans-Canada Capital has made notable investments in digital assets. It manages the pension assets for Air Canada, as one of the largest corporate pension plans in the country. The pension fund added $55 million in a spot bitcoin ETF.\nInstitutional adoption of bitcoin has accelerated over the past year, driven by clearer regulatory guidance, the launch of spot ETFs and increasing recognition of bitcoin as a strategic asset. Schedule 1 banks in Canada are holding more than $139 million in bitcoin exchange-traded funds, underscoring growing institutional demand and long-term positioning.\nQ. How might institutional accumulation affect bitcoin’s market dynamics?\nA.Last year, ETFs purchased approximately 500,000 bitcoin, while the network produced 164,250 new bitcoin through its proof-of-work consensus. This means ETF demand alone was three times the newly minted supply. Additionally, public and private corporations purchased 250,000 bitcoins. As governments consider including bitcoin in their strategic reserves, other entities are exploring the addition of bitcoin to their corporate treasuries.\nQ. How will the Financial Conduct Authority(FCA)greenlighting retail access to crypto ETNs in the U.K. accelerate the retail & institutional adoption?\nA.This marks an important moment for crypto products in the retail market as an asset class that reflects a broader shift inthe U.K.’s regulatorystance toward digital assets. It is a complete reversal from a 2020 decision when the FCA banned crypto exchange-traded notes. ETNs will need to be traded on an FCA-approved investment exchange. The U.K. is shifting its approach to crypto as the government seeks to grow the economy and support a digital assets industry, sending a strong signal to institutional investors that the U.K. is positioning itself as a competing player in the global crypto market.\n-Kevin Tam, digital asset research specialist\nETH reached a newall-time highon Sunday, Aug. 24, touching $4900.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department plans to start releasingdata and statics on blockchain.\nThailand selects KuCoin to provide access totokenized bonds.",

    "description": "Chainlink's LINK and Pyth's token surged after they announced that they will deliver official macroeconomic data feeds from the U.S. Commerce Department on blockchain.",
    "content": "The native token of the Chainlink network, LINK, surged more than 5% after the network announced a partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce to bring official government economic data onchain, marking a first-of-its-kind effort to bridge public data infrastructure with blockchain applications.\nPyth Network wasalso selectedalongside Chainlink, sending its native token, PYTH, up nearly 50% after the announcement.\nKey macroeconomic statistics from the Bureau of Economic Analysis — such as Real Gross Domestic Product(GDP), the Personal Consumption Expenditures(PCE)Price Index, and Real Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers — are now accessible onchain through Chainlink Data Feeds, the company announced in ablog post on Thursday. Six data points in total are being published, including both absolute levels and annualized percentage changes.\nThe data is being made available across ten blockchain networks, including EthereumETH$4,381.98, AvalancheAVAX$23.19and OptimismOP$0.6801. Chainlink says the feeds will update monthly or quarterly, mirroring the release schedules of their traditional counterparts.\nMeanwhile, Pyth said it will initially offer quarterly GDP data releases going back five years, with expectations to expand the initiative to other economic datasets.\nThe initiative, a first for the U.S. government, opens up new possibilities for developers building in DeFi and beyond.\nFor example, lending protocols could adjust interest rates based on GDP trends, while prediction markets might incorporate the PCE Index to crowdsource inflation forecasts.\n\"Bringing U.S. government data onchain unlocks innovative use cases for blockchain markets, such as automated trading strategies, increased composability of tokenized assets, the issuance of new types of digital assets, real-time prediction markets for crowdsourced intelligence, transparent dashboards powered by immutable data, and DeFi protocol risk management based on macroeconomic factors,\" Chainlink's blog post said.\nBringing economic data sets onto the blockchain also brings efficiency and transparency to data published by the government.\n\"The integrity of economic data is essential to global markets, and bringing this data onchain opens up new frontiers for transparency, accessibility, and composability across DeFi, enterprise use cases, and public accountability,\" Pyth said in its statement.\nChainlink and other crypto industry players have deepened their engagement with U.S. policymakers this year after Donald Trump won the U.S. election last year, with the promise to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world.\nChainlink had held several meetings with the Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC)to help clarify how blockchain infrastructure fits within existing broker-dealer and transfer agent rules, as well as other lawmakers to help establish the GENIUS Act, the company said.\nBy bringing federal economic indicators onchain, Chainlink is attempting to normalize blockchain as a destination for mission-critical public data — offering transparency and composability that traditional systems don’t easily support, it said.\nThe move highlights the U.S. government's push to adopt blockchain technology for public data infrastructure. On Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the Department of Commerce plans to begin publishing economic statistics — including GDP figures — onchain as part of an effort to expand blockchain-based data distribution across federal agencies.\nLutnick said the initiative aims to modernize how official data is shared by making it more transparent and tamper-proof, without disclosing how the government is planning to do so.\nHe said the Department hopes to set a precedent for other agencies to follow by moving key indicators like GDP to the blockchain, laying the groundwork for a more secure and interoperable system for releasing government data.\n\"Secretary Lutnick and the Department of Commerce’s visionary stance on data innovation and willingness to embrace blockchain technology is positioning the U.S. as a world leader in finance. But this is just the first step in a long and high-yielding endeavor to rebuild the data infrastructure of the United States of America,\" Pyth said in its statement on Thursday.\nRead more:Chainlink's LINK Gains on Joining SEC Crypto Task Force's Tokenization Initiative\nUPDATE(Aug 28, 15:00 UTC):Updates the headline and story throuhgout to add more information about the government wanting to use blockchain for public data infrastructure.

    "description": "Built on Discrete Log Contracts from Atomic Finance, Lygos says its new BTC credit platform avoids the custodial risks that sank Celsius, BlockFi and Voyager.",
    "content": "Lygos Finance unveiled what it calls the first truly non-custodial bitcoinBTC$107,581.13-backed lending platform, aiming to transform the crypto credit market with institutional-grade design.\nThe platform is built on Discrete Log Contracts(DLCs)developed by Atomic Finance, which Lygos acquired earlier this year.\nDLCs enforce bilateral lending agreements directly on Bitcoin’s base layer, with an external oracle attesting to facts like BTC-USD prices, but not controlling the funds. Borrowers and lenders sign Contract Execution Transactions, meaning settlement happens entirely on the Bitcoin blockchain without custodians or smart-contract risk.\n“True non-custodial means exactly this,” CEO Jay Patel said in an emailed announcement on Thursday. “No participant other than the borrower and lender can move the funds.”\nLygos supports up to $100 million, with BTC collateralized in a native 2-of-2 script and USDC/USDT issued on Ethereum. The model avoids wrapped bitcoin or synthetic collateral, keeping custody native on both sides of the transaction.\nDuring the 2021 crypto bull market, centralized lenders such asCelsius Network,Voyager DigitalandBlockFidrew billions in deposits by promising high yields. But these returns were often built on risky, interconnected loans.\nThe system unraveled in 2022, when thecollapse of the Terra-Luna stablecoinand the bankruptcy of hedge fundThree Arrows Capital(3AC)left many of the major lenders exposed. Mass withdrawals followed, forcing firms to freeze assets and file for bankruptcy. Customers lostmuch of their deposited funds, and the reputation of bitcoin lending took a severe hit.\nBy enforcing agreements directly on the Bitcoin layer 1, Lygos said it can restore confidence with transparent, enforceable contracts and no reliance on custodians. The debut marks a fresh attempt to reimagine bitcoin credit markets, this time with non-custodial rails.",

    "title": "Bitcoin, Ether ETF Flows Hint at Incoming Altcoin Bull Run: Crypto Daybook Americas",
    "description": "Your day-ahead look for Aug. 28, 2025",
    "content": "By Omkar Godbole(All times ET unless indicated otherwise)\nAs August draws to a close, two observations stand out. First, the month's typical surge in volatility in both traditional and cryptocurrency markets has not materialized.\nThat's probably driven by market expectations of forthcoming Fed interest-rate cuts combined with record fiscal spending—essentially an amplified “Goldilocks” scenario. Yet, it raises the question:How much stimulus is too much?\nSecond, institutional flows reveal a divergence between bitcoinBTC$107,581.13and ether(ETH). The U.S. ether ETFs have registered a net investment of $3.69 billion this month, extending the four-month inflows streak. Bitcoin ETFs, in contrast, have seen an outflow of over $800 million, the second-highest on record. The difference is a sign of investor rotation into ether from its larger rival and possibly a bull run in altcoins ahead.\nThat brings us to the key trend to watch out for in the coming month: the boom in altcoin treasury companies.\n\"The rise of altcoin treasuries can be the decisive spark that ignites the final phase of the current market cycle and ushers in another wave of the altseason,\" said Ray Yossef, a crypto market analyst and founder of crypto app NoOnes.\nBig names like BitMine, SharpLink, Galaxy Capital, Pantera and even corporations like Trump Media have begun focusing on blue-chip altcoins like ETH, SOL, BNB, and CRO as treasury-grade reserve assets, Yossef said in an email.\n\"Billions of dollars are being allocated and reallocated into these treasuries, and that institutional vote of confidence is boosting the perception of altcoins, signaling that institutional capital is no longer reserved exclusively for BTC,\" he said.\nIn his latest article, Arthur Hayes, CIO and co-founder of Maelstrom Fund,predictedthat ENA, ETHFI, and HYPE will rally 51x, 34x, and 126x, respectively, by 2028.\nOver the next 24 hours, BTC traders should keep an eye on $113,600, as this level may experience an increase inselling pressure fromshort-term traders who reach their breakeven. The market focus seems to be on smaller altcoins. The CoinDesk 80 Index was recently up over 4% on a 24-hour basis while the CoinDesk 20 Index added just 0.82%.\nIn key news,Bybit announcedthe addition of Volmex's bitcoin and ether implied volatility indices to its Advanced Earn Page, a hub for high-yield structured products. The move underscores the growing demand for volatility trading.\nIn traditional markets, bond yield curves continue to steepen across the advanced world, with longer-duration yields rising to multi-month/decade highs. Stay alert!\nTheCoinDesk Policy & Regulation conference(formerly known as State of Crypto)is a one-day boutique event held in Washington on Sept. 10 that allows general counsels, compliance officers and regulatory executives to meet with public officials responsible for crypto legislation and regulatory oversight.

    "content": "Buying the YZY tokenapparently linked to Ye,the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, ended in tears for more than 70,000 wallets, Bubblemaps, a blockchain data visualization tool, said in a post on X.\nThe Solana-based memecoin's debut last week was part of a “YZY Money” ecosystem plan, which included payment rails and a branded card.\nOn-chain data, however, suggests that insider and early wallets, combined with thin liquidity and rapid speculation, resulted in a launch where whales extracted millions, while the crowd shouldered nearly all of the losses.\nThe updated$YZYnumbers are worse than we thought70,000+ total traders> 51,862 lost $1–$1k> 5,269 lost $1k–$10k> 1,025 lost $10k–$100k> 108 lost $100k–$1M> 3 lost $1M+Meanwhile, 11 wallets made $1M+pic.twitter.com/I9ZaBJepAM\nMore than 51,800 addresses appear to have lost between $1 and $1,000, another 5,269 are down $1,000 to $10,000, and 1,025 wallets shed $10,000 to $100,000, according to Bubblemaps' data.\nAt the top of the loss curve, 108 wallets are sitting on six-figure drawdowns, while three traders lost more than $1 million each.\nOn the other side of the calculation, 11 addresses booked profit of $1 million or more, just 0.015% of the total. An estimated 99 wallets generated over $100,000, while 2,541 wallets cleared at least $1,000.\nThe crowd as a whole is down some $8.2 million, despite some insiders pocketing substantial wins. So while 18,000 wallets technically profited, the concentration was brutal. The real money sat with the top 11, while the rest barely moved the needle.\nThe lopsided distribution reflects the structural flaws flagged from day one, as CoinDesk noted in its earlier story.\nA full 70% of the supply was earmarked for Yeezy Investments LLC, locked under Jupiter’s vesting system, with only 20% sold to the public and 10% used for liquidity.\nThe pool itself was seeded with YZY tokens alone without a stablecoin pair — a design that leaves the door open to sudden liquidity pulls, not unlike theshort-lived LIBRA tokenpromoted in Argentina in February.\nOn-chain analysts identified wallets with early access. At the time of the issuance, address 6MNWV8 spent 450,611 USDC for 1.29 million YZY at $0.35, flipped 1.04 million tokens for 1.39 million USDC, and still holds roughly 249,907 YZY worth about $600,000 to make a quick $1.5 million profit.\nAs of Thursday, YZY’s market cap has deflated to $544.9 million with $42.7 million in liquidity and 26,590 holders, down sharply from the initial frenzy that briefly saw valuations touted as high as $3 billion.\nDaily volume has slumped to $1.8 million, DEXTools data shows, a fraction of early activity.\nYZY’s performance closely mirrorsthat of many celebrity-based memecoins, where the chance of hitting life-changing gains is effectively zero unless you were already in on the inside.\nCoinDesk has contacted Ye by email for comment.",

    "description": "Metaverse platform The Sandbox is cutting more than half its staff and closing offices worldwide as Animoca Brands assumes direct control amid dwindling users.",
    "content": "Metaverse platform The Sandbox is undergoing a sweeping restructuring that will see more than half of its roughly 250 employees laid off, according to a report from French crypto outletThe Big Whale.\nThe move comes alongside a leadership shake-up in which co-founders Arthur Madrid and Sebastien Borget have been sidelined from executive roles, according to the report.\nAnimoca Brands told CoinDesk in an emailed statement that both Madrid and Borget have been moved to new \"strategic roles\" within the Sandbox ecosystem. Madrid is now the chairman of the board of The Sandbox, and Borget is its global ambassador. Robby Yung, CEO of investments at Animoca Brands and a director of The Sandbox, has been appointed as CEO of The Sandbox.\nAnimoca also noted that Sandbox has always been \"controlled by Animoca Brands\" and that Yat Siu, the co-founder and executive chairman of  Animoca Brands, has been a primary driver of the project since 2018.\n\"The restructuring represents The Sandbox’s and Animoca Brands’ commitment to the platform, SAND token holders, LAND owners, and the broader community,\" said Animoca's spokesperson.\nThe restructuring reportedly also includes closing offices in Argentina, Uruguay, South Korea, Thailand, and Turkey, with the company’s base in Lyon also expected to shutter.\nAnimoca confirmed the closure of five work locations as part of the restructuring, noting that multiple such locations consisted of just 1-3 freelance contractors working remotely or in coworking spaces. Sandbox will have nine locations around the globe after restructuring.\nThe measures highlight the platform’s struggle to translate years of investment into sustained user engagement. Despite raising $300 million over the past eight years, The Sandbox has seen its daily active users dwindle to just a few hundred, many of whom, Big Whale's sources alleged, are bots operating primarily in South America—a claim that Animoca's spokesperson contested in the email statement to CoinDesk.\n\"Regarding the claim that The Sandbox has 'many' bots, The Sandbox does not tolerate abuse of its Terms of Service and actively invests in robust fraud prevention and anti-cheat measures in monitoring, preventing, and addressing fraudulent or automated activity to protect the experience of players.\"\nAnimoca also told CoinDesk that Sandbox's daily active users fluctuate significantly based on in-game events, most notably the Alpha Seasons.\n\"During an Alpha Season(the most recent one concluded in May 2025), the Game Client component of The Sandbox, which is how users access and play the game, experiences a high level of user activity. That activity subsides after the end of the event,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe platform’s native token, SAND, has also performed poorly despite the crypto market entering an\"altcoin season\"in recent months. It had a market cap of $6.2 billion in 2021—during the last crypto bull run.\nAfter years of brutal crypto winter, that figure has now slumped to around $700 million following a 90% drawdown.\nTotal crypto market cap is up by 26% since Nov. 2021, according to TradingView data.UPDATE(Aug. 31, 17:18 UTC:)Updates the story throughout to add comments from Animoca regarding the restructuring. Also, notes that Robby Yung has become The Sandbox's CEO, not Yat Siu, as was reported earlier. Also removed the second and third last paragraphs from the previous story, which talked about Sandbox's crypto treasury.",

    "content": "As bitcoinBTC$107,581.13bulls aim to reestablish an upward price trajectory, they may face resistance from sellers near the $113,600 level, according to on-chain data.\nBTC has already bounced to $112,800 from sub-$108,800 levels hit Tuesday,CoinDesk datashow. The bounce is likely fueled by a fresh all-time high in the S&P 500 and a better-than-expected earnings report by Nvidia, one of the largest publicly listed companies in the world by market value and a bellwether for all things artificial intelligence.\nThe path ahead may prove challenging, as investors holding at a loss may look to sell into any price rebound.\n\"Currently, bitcoin trades beneath the cost basis of both the 1-month($115.6k)and 3-month($113.6k)cohorts, leaving these investors under stress. Any relief rally is therefore likely to encounter resistance, as short-term holders seek to exit at breakeven,\" analytics firmGlassnode saidin a report published Wednesday.\nGlassnode's cost basis metric reveals the average purchase prices at which digital assets have been acquired by wallets with varying holding durations. For example, the three-month cost basis of $113,600 indicates that investors holding assets purchased within the past three months paid, on average, this price level.\nAs of now, the spot market flows suggest an uphill battle for the bulls ahead, while ETF and corporate activity suggest otherwise.\n\"Spot demand remains neutral, as perpetuals tilt bearish with CVD negative. The current funding rate of ~0.01% points to a fragile neutrality. If price breaks above $112.4K with volume, it opens the pathway to $114K – $116K,\" Timothy Misir, head of research,BRN.\nThat said, ETF inflows and corporate adoption of BTC continues to suck out significant supply from the market, offering a bullish hope, Misir explained.\n\"ETF flows continue to strengthen with $81 million for Bitcoin ETFs and $307 million for Ether ETFs over the past day. ETFs, corporates, and governments are now absorbing ~3,600 BTC/day, which translates to ~4x miner issuance. Metaplanet announced a new plan to raise $881 million to buy $837 million BTC in Sep–Oct, adding to its 18,991 BTC,\" he noted.\nShould BTC turn lower, then $107,000 is the key support level to watch.\nThat's because analysis by Glassnode shows that the six-month cost basis is at that level. So, a break lower would prompt these holdings to sell, potentially causing a more profound decline.\n\"The 6-month cost basis sits near ~$107k. A sustained move below this level risks triggering fear, which could accelerate downside momentum,\" Glassnode said.",

    "description": "Dollar dominance thanks to stablecoins is pushing China to explore stablecoins, but capital controls limit the project to Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market, where liquidity is thin.\n",
    "content": "Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, seeCoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.China’s growing focus on stablecoins is less about embracing crypto and more about defending its currency from U.S. dollar dominance, says Dr. Vera Yuen of Hong Kong University's Business School, who argues the shift highlights offshore opportunities but also deep domestic limits.\nBeijing's shift comes as Washington moved first to create a regulatory framework for the stablecoin industry in the U.S. Reutersrecently reported that China's State Councilis reviewing a roadmap for yuan-backed stablecoins later this month, with Hong Kong and Shanghai expected to fast-track adoption.\nIn an earlier interview, Animoca Group president Evan Auyangtold CoinDeskthe trigger was the U.S. GENIUS Act, which cements dollar-pegged tokens as part of global finance.\nHe said the law is “pressuring China to act a lot faster,” pushing Beijing to consider stablecoins not as speculative instruments, as once described by the People's Bank of China, but as necessary infrastructure to keep pace in global trade and settlement.\nYuen said the government firstprioritized the e-CNY, its Central Bank Digital Currency, because it offered control, traceability, and seigniorage profits — features that regulators valued over those of privately issued tokens. But she noted that stablecoins have a clear edge in international use.\n“Many CBDCs are developed for domestic use, so for international use of CBDCs, there is a big problem of interoperability of different systems. Stablecoins are designed to be used internationally, so it can be a better option for cross-border transactions,” she told CoinDesk.\n\"Focusing on stablecoins allows China to respond proactively to global regulatory debates and technological advances, ensuring it remains competitive and prepared as the digital currency landscape evolves,\" Yuen continued.\nCapital controls still mean any yuan token will stay offshore, with Hong Kong’s new regime providing the testing ground. However,limited CNH liquidityunderscores how narrow the runway is for China’s internationalization push.\n\"This would limit the issuance of offshore renminbi stablecoins, constraining its attractiveness as a means of payment,\" Yuen said.\nChina is also not moving in isolation.\nIn Japan,Monex Group is preparing to issuea yen-backed stablecoin tied to government bonds, joining other domestic players such as SBI and JPYC.\nUnlike China, however, where capital controls push experimentation offshore, Japan’s regulators are laying the groundwork for stablecoins to circulate at home, signaling Asia’s broader race to keep pace with U.S. dollar tokens.\nFor now, Beijing’s stablecoin experiment looks less like a replacement for the e-CNY and more like a cautious complement, a way to extend the yuan’s reach abroad without loosening its grip at home.\nBTC:BTC held at $111K as Nvidia posted strong earnings.\nETH:ETH is trading at $4,500, and history shows that a green August often precedes a 60% year-end rally, though typically after a September dip.\nGold:Gold traded Wednesday at $3,443 per ounce, up 1.6% from Tuesday’s close, extending a 37% year-over-year rally, though prices slipped in early trading as attention turned to Nvidia earnings and Trump’s Fed feud.\nS&P 500:The S&P 500 rose 0.2% Wednesday, pushing Wall Street to a new all-time high ahead of Nvidia’s earnings.\nFormer Polymarket exec raises $15 million from Coinbase and USV for rival prediction platform (The Block)\nFinastra Taps Circle to Bring USDC Settlement to $5T Global Cross-Border Payments (CoinDesk)\nKnow Your Issuer': This Tech Combats Counterfeit Coins, Starting With USDC and PYUSD (Decrypt)",

Each token, branded USDVB, represents one U.S. dollar held on deposit at VersaBank USA.\nThe program will simulate thousands of transactions of small value, first internally and then with select external partners.

A stablecoin, like Circle's USDC or Tether's USDT, is typically issued by a private company and backs the tokens' value with reserves held at a third-party custodian.

    "content": "Finastra, a London-based financial tech provider to some of the world's largest banks, said Wednesday it will connect its payments hub to Circle’s(CRCL)USDC stablecoin, giving banks an option to settle cross-border transfers with the token.\nThe integration will begin with Finastra’s Global PAYplus(GPP), which processes more than $5 trillion in daily cross-border payment flows, the firms said inthe press release.\nThe move underlines how stablecoins, a group of cryptocurrencies with prices anchored predominantly to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, are increasingly being tested by major financial institutions as alternatives to traditional settlement channels. Payments giantsStripeandPayPalalready have their own stablecoin infrastructure in place, while severalmajor banks,large retailersreportedly explore having their own tokens.\nStablecoins allow around-the-clock, near-instant settlements at lower costs using blockchain rails, proponents say.  Coinbaseprojectedthe stablecoin market to grow to $1.2 trillion by 2028 from the current $270 billion, driven by regulatory clarity in the U.S. and accelerating corporate adoption. USDC is the second largest stablecoin on the market, boasting a $69 billion supply.\nBy enabling settlement in USDC while keeping instructions in fiat currencies, Circle and Finastra said banks can reduce their reliance on correspondent networks, which are often criticized for high fees and slow processing times.\nIntegrating Circle's stablecoin rails into Finastra's plumbing aims to give \"banks the tools they need to innovate in cross-border payments without having to build a standalone payment processing infrastructure,\" said Chris Walters, CEO of Finastra.\n\"Together, we’re enabling financial institutions to test and launch innovative payment models that combine blockchain technology with the scale and trust of the existing banking system,\" Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said.\nCircle went public earlier this year, with its stock skyrocketing as investors sought exposure to the booming stablecoin market.

    "description": "Solana's SOL surged past $208, outpacing broader markets as analysts weigh breakout signals, treasury demand and new institutional validator activity.",
    "content": "Solana's SOL outperformed the broader crypto market on Wednesday, climbing 7.68% in 24 hours to trade at $208.24,according to CoinDesk Data. By comparison, theCoinDesk 20 Index(CD20)rose 2.89% and the total crypto market cap gained just 1.6% during the same period.\nAnalysts said Solana’s strong performance reflects a combination of technical momentum and structural demand.\nScott Melker, a trader known as the “Wolf of All Streets,”arguedthat Solana is now at a critical level against bitcoin. He said a breakout here could make SOL the “darling” of the next altcoin cycle. His chart showed SOL pressing into resistance against BTC, a pairing that often signals whether a token can outperform the broader market.\nAnother analyst, Lark Davis, was more direct, calling Solana the “catch-up trade” for investors who missed ether’s(ETH)breakout from $1,400 during the last cycle.\nDaviscitedthree drivers: the rise of SOL-based treasury companies modeled on bitcoin accumulation firms, the prospect of a spot SOL ETF getting approved in the near future by the U.S. SEC and growing institutional interest. These factors could push billions of dollars into SOL, he noted.\nHowever, Altcoin Sherpa, another widely followed analyst on X,cautionedagainst chasing the rally. He described SOL's strength as unusual but advised traders to consider taking profits between $205 and $215 or waiting for more clarity before entering. His view reflects the risk that weekend or short-term rallies often retrace once liquidity normalizes.\nMeanwhile, DeFi asset management firm Sentoraaddedanother perspective, noting that more than $820 million in SOL is already held in corporate treasuries. The number is worth noting as ETH treasury holdings stood at a similar level in April before expanding to nearly $20 billion. The firm said that the SOL corporate holding trajectory suggests the token could follow a similar path if adoption accelerates.\nAdding to the positive sentiments of some analysts, Solana is also seeing institutional adoption grow. Earlier today, staking service provider Chorus Oneannouncedthe launch of a new Solana validator in partnership with Delphi Consulting, part of Delphi Digital.\nThe firms said the move reflects a belief that institutions should contribute not just capital but also infrastructure to the networks they back. Chorus One described the validator as institutional-grade infrastructure, positioning it as part of Solana’s growing base of serious, long-term participants.\nTechnical Analysis Highlights\nAccording to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, between Aug. 26 at 15:00 UTC and Aug. 27 at 14:00 UTC, SOL rose from $191.67 to $204.62, a 7% gain, with a trading range of $190.11–$205.65.\nHeavy volume at $193.92 during the early rebound(986,571 tokens traded)established this level as strong support.\nResistance formed near $205.65, with repeated rejections around that corridor. Sustained price action above $202.00 suggests institutional buying.\nIn the final hour of trading, SOL dipped to $202.95 before surging to an intraday high of $205.84 on strong volume.\nKey support is now near $202.82, while resistance is around $205.84. Bullish momentum points toward the $210.00 psychological barrier.",

    "content": "The native token of Hyperliquid(HYPE)surged to a fresh all-time high early Wednesday, continuing its meteoric climb this year as the decentralized exchange best known for on-chain perpetual trading has attracted record activity.\nThe token broke through the $50 mark for the first time, gaining about 8% in the past 24 hours. HYPE is now up 430% since its April nadir and up roughly 15x since it began trading in late November at around $3.\nThe rally has been fueled by record trading activity across the exchange and its automated buyback mechanism, which steadily absorbs tokens from the market and reduces circulating supply.\nRead more:Hyperliquid Now Dominates DeFi Derivatives, Processing $30B a Day\nThe decentralized exchange recorded more than $357 billion in derivatives volume in August, according toDefiLlamadata, up from $319 billion in July and nearly ten times higher than a year ago.

Hyperliquid booked $105 million in trading fees during August, the highest this year, per DefiLlama data.\nMuch of those earnings are funneled directly into purchasing HYPE on the market through Hyperliquid's Assistance Fund. The facility is an automated on-chain mechanism that buys back tokens on the open market, creating sustained buy pressure for HYPE and effectively reducing the circulating supply.\nSince its launch in January, the fund’s holdings ballooned from 3 million tokens to 29.8 million HYPE, now worth over $1.5 billion, fueling the token's rally.\nOn the news front, digital asset custodian BitGoadded supporton Tuesday for the HyperEVM network, which underpins the Hyperliquid ecosystem, unlocking institutional access to HYPE and related applications.\nIn a recent research note, ByteTree analysts Shehriyar Ali and Charlie Morris described Hyperliquid as a \"powerhouse\" that has become the largest decentralized perpetual futures venue.\n\"All things considered, HyperLiquid is among the most compelling protocols in DeFi today,\" they wrote. \"Its strong fundamentals, record-breaking fee generation and dominant market share make it impossible to ignore.\"\nDespite the bullish fundamentals, the report also flagged concerns about the token's valuation. HYPE currently trades at a fully diluted valuation(FDV)of over $50 billion, with only about third of supply in circulation with a 16.8 billion market capitalization.\nScheduled token unlocks starting in November could also introduce selling pressure, potentially testing the strength of demand, the report noted.\n\"Although the token has already seen a sharp run-up in recent months, its robust on-chain activity continues to underpin its valuation,\" the analysts said.\nRead more:XPL Futures on Hyperliquid See $130M Wiped Out Ahead of the Plasma Token's Launch",

    "description": "Also: Bitcoin Liquid Staking News, Optimism and Flashbots Team Up, Hemi Labs Raises $15M.",
    "content": "Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk.\nIn this issue:\nBITCOIN MINING PLAYERS FACE CHALLENGING MARKET:Bitcoin miners have long been defined by the boom-and-bust rhythm of the four-year halving cycle. But the game has now changed, some of the industry’s most prominent executives said at the SALT conference in Jackson Hole earlier this week. The rise of exchange-traded funds, surging demand for power and the prospect of artificial intelligence(AI)reshaping infrastructure needs mean miners must find ways to diversify or risk being left behind. “We used to come here and talk about hash rate,” said Matt Schultz, CEO of Cleanspark. “Now we’re talking about how to monetize megawatts.” For years, mining companies — whose revenue derived mainly from producing bitcoin — lived and died by the halving cycle. Every four years, rewards were slashed in half and miners scrambled to cut costs or scale up to survive. According to these executives, that rhythm no longer defines the business. “The four-year cycle is effectively broken with the maturation of bitcoin as a strategic asset, with the ETF and now the strategic treasury and whatnot,” Schultz said. “The adoption is driving demand. If you read anything about the most recent ETF, they've consumed infinitely more bitcoin than have been generated so far this year.” Cleanspark, which now operates800 megawatts of energy infrastructureand has another 1.2 gigawatts in development, has begun turning its attention beyond proof-of-work. “Our speed to market with the electricity has created opportunities such that now we can look at ways to monetize power beyond just bitcoin mining,” he said. “With 33 locations, we now have a great deal more flexibility than we ever did before.” Schultz is not alone in calling the industry's shift in business model. Patrick Fleury, CFO of Terawulf, echoed the sentiment and didn’t sugarcoat the profit squeeze the miners are feeling. “Bitcoin mining is an incredibly difficult business,” he said. He broke down the economics of bitcoin mining in straightforward terms: with electricity costing five cents per kilowatt hour, it currently costs around $60,000 to mine a single bitcoin. At a bitcoin price of $115,000, that means half the revenue is consumed by power alone. Once corporate expenses and other operating costs are factored in, the margins tighten quickly. In his view, profitability in mining hinges almost entirely on securing ultra-low-cost power. —Helene BraunRead more.\nBITCOIN LIQUID STAKING RISES:For most of its history, bitcoin has been touted by its supporters as digital gold: an asset to hold rather than use. That passivity has left trillions of dollars’ worth of BTC sitting idle in wallets, disconnected from the yield strategies and composability that define decentralized finance(DeFi). The rise of liquid staking tokens promises to change that, positioning bitcoin not only as a store of value but as a productive asset integrated into on-chain capital markets. Liquid staking allows users to offer their crypto to help secure a network and receive in return a liquid, tradable token that represents the staked assets and can be used across DeFi while the original tokens continue earning staking rewards. Lombard Finance has emerged as one of the prominent projects in bitcoin liquid staking. Its flagship product, LBTC, is a yield-bearing token backed 1:1 by BTC. When BTC is deposited into the Lombard protocol, the underlying coins are staked, primarily viaBabylon, a protocol enabling trustless, self-custodial bitcoin staking. Users receive LBTC in return, which can be deployed across DeFi ecosystems while the original bitcoin earns staking rewards. This dual functionality is key. Holders can keep exposure to bitcoin while using LBTC in lending, borrowing and liquidity provision across protocols such as Aave, Morpho, Pendle and Ether.fi. Designed for interoperability, LBTC moves across Ethereum, Base, BNB Chain and other networks, preventing liquidity fragmentation and ensuring bitcoin can participate in a multi-chain DeFi environment. —Jamie CrawleyRead more.\nOPTIMISM AND FLASHBOTS TEAM UP:Optimism is teaming up with Flashbots to revamp how transactions are processed across its OP Stack ecosystem, aiming to make some of Ethereum’s most popular layer-2 networks faster and more customizable. The partnership centers on sequencing, the behind-the-scenes process that determines how quickly a transaction confirms, which trades are prioritized, and how much users ultimately pay. Optimism says Flashbots’ infrastructure, which is already responsible forbuilding more than 90% of Ethereum’s blocks, will now bring near-instant confirmations and user-friendly transaction ordering to every chain in the so-called Superchain.This matters because theOP Stack underpins more than 60%of all Ethereum layer-2 activity, the Optimism team claims, including some of the most well-known layer-2 chains like Base, Unichain, World Chain, Ink and Soneium. Until now, advanced sequencing features such as ultra-fast settlement, frontrunning protection and custom compliance rules were available only to the largest chains with resources to build them in-house. With Flashbots on board, those features will be available via tools for any project building on Optimism’s OP stack. —Margaux NijkerkRead more.\nHEMI LABS RAISES $15 MILLION:Hemi Labs, the Bitcoin programmability network founded by Jeff Garzik, raised $15 million in funding to accelerate development and expand its ecosystem.

In aLinkedIn postpublished Tuesday, Rich Widmann, Google’s head of Web3 strategy, provided fresh details on the project, known as theGoogle Cloud Universal Ledger(GCUL). He described the platform as a credibly neutral, high-performance blockchain designed for institutions, supporting Python-based smart contracts to make it more accessible to developers and financial engineers. “Any financial institution can build with GCUL,” Widmann said, arguing that while companies like Tether may be unlikely to adopt Circle’s blockchain and payment firms like Adyen may hesitate to use Stripe’s, Google’s neutral infrastructure removes those barriers. —Siamak MasnaviRead more.\nThe crypto industry's Washington lobbyists are trying to draw a line in the sand over the market structure bill that's steaming through the U.S. Senate, saying they can't back a law that wouldn't fully protect software developers from being held responsible for bad actors abusing their technology. The industry made its case to the Senate's Banking and Agriculture committees \"with one voice,\" sending a letter Wednesday signed by Coinbase, Kraken, Ripple, a16z, Uniswap Labs and more than a hundred other crypto businesses and organizations, including almost all of the major U.S. lobbying groups.

    "description": "Kelly Ye and Helena Lam of Avenir Group explore how liquidity indicators could reveal underlying capital flows and liquidity conditions for ether, and how there may still be ample room for expansion as institutional interest accelerates.",
    "content": "In our previous research reporttitledBitcoin’s Liquidity Trifecta: Unpacking Liquidity Across On-Chain Data, Market Microstructure and Macro Drivers, we explored how various liquidity indicators could reveal underlying capital flows and liquidity conditions for bitcoin. Applying that same framework to ether(ETH)gives us valuable insight into its current liquidity profile — both on-chain and in the broader market. In this update, we also highlight the growing role of digital asset treasuries(DATs)which have emerged as a key driver behind ETH’s recent rally.\nWebinar alert:On September 9 at 11:00am ET joinMichelle Noyesfrom AIMA andAndy Baehr from CoinDesk Indices as they discuss building a sustainable business in the cyclical markets of crypto.

Since the cycle low in November 2022, ETH has absorbedover $81 billionin fresh capital inflows, pushing its realized cap to a new all-time high of$266 billionas of August 8th, 2025.\nFor context, this represents a43% increasefor ETH over the period — substantial, but still well below bitcoin’s136%rise in realized cap. The slower growth rate suggests that while ETH has been attracting meaningful new investment, there may still be ample room for expansion as institutional interest accelerates.\nIn our bitcoin study, we developed a method to estimate genuine institutional demand by isolating ETF inflows not tied to hedged arbitrage trades. Applying this framework to ETH shows that80–90% of spot ETH ETF inflowsare likely genuine institutional allocations, with the remainder driven by arbitrage strategies — long spot positions hedged via CME futures to capture price differentials.\nInterestingly, the proportion of arbitrage-related flows is much higher for ETH than bitcoin, where only around3%of spot ether ETF inflows are estimated to be arbitrage-based. This highlights that institutional allocation to ETH still lags behind BTC, though we expect this gap to close gradually with the recent influx of institutional interest in the cryptocurrency.\nData source: Avenir, CFTC, Glassnode\nAs of July 21st, combined open interest(OI)in ETH futures and options stood at$71 billion. However, unlike bitcoin — where OI in perpetual futures and options is nearly balanced — ETH options OI remains less than half of perpetual futures OI.\nGiven that options are more often used by professional traders and institutions, this imbalance indicates that institutional derivatives participation in ETH still has significant room to grow.\nOrder book analysis reveals notable sentiment shifts. When ETH regained $3,800 in July after 7 months, a strong sell-side skew emerged on the limit order books(LOB), suggesting intense, long-awaited profit-taking. But as the price retraced toward $3,300, buy-side depth increased significantly, signaling “buy-the-dip” behavior at that level. Since then, the order book has shown a more balanced supply-demand profile, suggesting no extreme positioning from the market at present.\nData source: Avenir, Binance\nA new and increasingly important source of demand for ETH comes from DATs — corporations that diversify into ETH by holding it on their balance sheets. For example, Bitmine and Sharplink are two of the most notable representatives of this trend.\nSince April, DATs have accumulated roughly4.1 million ETH ($17.6 billion), representing about3.4%of the circulating supply; Bitmine alone accounts for 1.3%. For context, U.S. spot ETH ETFs currently hold 5.4% of ETH total supply. This highlights the scale of these structural allocations from DATs.\nWhat sets DAT flows apart is their long-duration nature. Unlike futures traders or ETF arbitrage inflows, treasury allocations are less likely to rotate capital frequently, making them a source of sticky structural demand.\nAcross on-chain and off-chain liquidity metrics, one theme is clear:ETH’s institutional participation is still in the early stages compared to bitcoin. Realized cap growth, ETF inflow composition and derivatives market structure all point to significant untapped potential.\nAt the same time, DAT allocations are becoming a powerful driver of sustained ETH flows, much like how corporate balance sheet strategies such as Strategy created a new structural demand channel that helped fuel bitcoin’s rally in late 2024.\nIf institutional adoption of ETH follows a trajectory similar to bitcoin’s, the coming months could see meaningful capital inflows, and with them, the potential for outsized performance.",

Between Aug. 26 at 15:00 and Aug. 27 at 14:00, the cryptocurrency moved within a $0.017 band – about 4% – from a high of $0.40 to a low of $0.38. After briefly testing resistance at $0.40 late on Aug. 26, XLM retraced to $0.39, a 2% dip from session openings, as sellers dominated overnight trading. Volumes ran above average at more than 45 million tokens exchanged, a sign that institutional activity remained elevated despite the pullback.\nThe spike in trading coincided with broader regulatory developments. Daily turnover surged 115% to $402.21 million when XLM touched $0.40, underscoring how institutional engagement has intensified alongside anticipation for possible approvals of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds. Recent filings for funds tied to domestically developed digital assets, including Stellar, have helped draw corporate and institutional money into the space even as policymakers weigh tighter oversight.\nIntraday action on Aug. 27 offered a snapshot of that dynamic.

    "description": "ADA rallied to $0.87 on surging volume, ignoring the SEC’s pause on Grayscale’s ETF and hinting at institutional interest.",
    "content": "Cardano’sADAtoken climbed 2% to $0.87 in the past 24 hours, echoing a broader recovery across crypto markets. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which tracks the largest digital assets, gained 2.8% over the same period.\nThe move came as traders weighed two major developments: growing confidence in a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s(SEC)decision to extend its review of Grayscale’s proposed spot Cardano exchange-traded fund(ETF)until late October 2025.\nADA traded in a tight but volatile $0.04 band, swinging between a low of $0.83 and a high of $0.88, according to data from CoinDesk Analytics. That spread of roughly 5% reflected heightened activity. At one point, the token broke sharply higher, surging from $0.84 to $0.88 on trading volumes that more than doubled the 24-hour average of 39.3 million.\nAfter the breakout, ADA settled into consolidation. Traders pegged resistance at $0.88, with new support forming around $0.85. Late-session action saw the price stabilize at $0.86, a level analysts say may point to institutional accumulation ahead of another potential rally.\nThe broader market backdrop has been choppy. Crypto assets fell sharply Monday as traders locked in profits from a weekend surge sparked by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish remarks in Jackson Hole. Those comments fueled expectations of rate cuts, which typically support risk assets like cryptocurrencies by making traditional yields less attractive. By Tuesday, investors appeared to treat the pullback as a buying opportunity, helping altcoins rebound.\nLower interest rates often act as a tailwind for the crypto sector, where investors hunt for higher returns compared with government debt. Historically, such conditions have set the stage for “altcoin season,” periods where smaller tokens outperform bitcoinBTC$107,581.13during consolidation phases.\nMeanwhile, the SEC’s delay of Grayscale’s Cardano ETF was widely anticipated, as the regulator has slowed nearly all spot crypto ETF decisions. While the news briefly injected uncertainty, ADA’s resilience suggested traders were more focused on broader market momentum and capital rotation from bitcoin into altcoins.",

    "content": "Symbiotic, a universal staking protocol and EigenLayer competitor, has introduced External Rewards, a feature designed to let networks offer their own token-based incentives to stakers and node operators.\nThe new feature, introduced on Wednesday, marks a step in Symbiotic’s push to make shared security a default feature across modular blockchain ecosystems.\nExternal Rewards gives protocols a way to distribute native tokens or points directly through the Symbiotic platform, layering these incentives alongside Symbiotic Points — the protocol’s economic coordination mechanism. The goal is to help networks bootstrap security, attract capital and evolve incentive models without rebuilding core infrastructure. All rewards appear in one interface, giving stakers and contributors a comprehensive view of their economic participation across networks.\n“This launch is a pivotal moment for Symbiotic and the broader shared security ecosystem,” said Misha Putiatin, the co-founder of Symbiotic, in a press release shared with CoinDesk. “Shared security is something we’ve been steadily building toward, and external rewards are proof of that work compounding. Each new primitive or feature we ship strengthens the foundation for others to build on.”\nSeveral protocols are already using External Rewards. Hyperlane, the interoperability protocol, is rewarding stakers securing its cross-chain Warp Routes with $HYPER tokens.\nSymbiotic’s universal staking framework currently supports everything from liquid restaked assets like ETH to hybrid and native staking models. By unifying rewards and security incentives under one platform, Symbiotic wants to become a cryptoeconomic coordination layer for a modular ecosystem.\n“The launch of external rewards builds on Symbiotic’s mission to make Universal Staking the cryptoeconomic coordination layer for modular, multichain infrastructure,” the team wrote in a press release.\nRead more:Symbiotic Launches 'Relay' to Bring Secure Staking Across Chains",

    "content": "Hut 8(HUT)is set to spin out most of its bitcoinBTC$107,581.13mining operations into American Bitcoin(ABTC)within the next week, a move that Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer said could re-rate the company’s shares.\nYesterday, Hut 8 unveiled plans todevelop 1.53 gigawatts(GW)of new capacity across four U.S. sites, in Louisiana, Texas and Illinois, more than doubling its power under management to 2.55 GW.\nPalmer raised Hut 8's price target to $36 from $33 and reiterated his buy rating on the stock. The new price target suggests nearly 40% upside from yesterday's close just below $26.\nPalmer noted the update was significant because it showed a clear path to monetizing Hut 8’s energy pipeline, with the company already securing land and power agreements, building infrastructure and negotiating with potential customers.\nBy separating its mining operations into ABTC, Hut 8 aims to position itself as an energy infrastructure pure-play, giving it better access to cheaper project financing by avoiding the volatility tied to bitcoin revenues, the analyst said.\nThe company has up to $2.4 billion in liquidity to support the expansion, including $1.2 billion in bitcoin, $330 million in credit facilities and a $1 billion equity program, the report noted.\nHut 8 is a flexible bet on both bitcoin and the artificial intelligence(AI)/high performance computing(HPC)boom, Palmer said.\nRead more:Bitcoin Miner Hut 8 Jumps 15%, Leading Sector Higher After Inking 5-Year Energy Supply Deal",

    "title": "Google Advances Its Layer-1 Blockchain; Here’s What We Know So Far",
    "description": "Rich Widmann, head of Web3 strategy at Google, outlined on Tuesday how his firm's upcoming layer-1 blockchain for finance differs from Stripe's Temp and Circle's Arc.",
    "content": "Google Cloud is moving forward with plans to launch its own layer-1(L1)blockchain, positioning the network as neutral infrastructure for global finance at a time when fintech competitors are developing out their own distributed ledgers.\nIn aLinkedIn postpublished Tuesday, Rich Widmann, Google’s head of Web3 strategy, provided fresh details on the project, known as theGoogle Cloud Universal Ledger(GCUL). He described the platform as a credibly neutral, high-performance blockchain designed for institutions, supporting Python-based smart contracts to make it more accessible to developers and financial engineers.\n“Any financial institution can build with GCUL,” Widmann said, arguing that while companies like Tether may be unlikely to adopt Circle’s blockchain and payment firms like Adyen may hesitate to use Stripe’s, Google’s neutral infrastructure removes those barriers.\nHe also expanded on a comparative chart by fintech strategist Chuk Okpalugo, highlighting how GCUL differs from Stripe’s Tempo and Circle’s Arc, two other high-profile L1 efforts.\nIn setting out Google’s case for the Universal Ledger, Widmann drew contrasts with two other high-profile entrants.\nStripe’s project,Tempo, is rooted in its payments empire, effectively extending the company’s existing merchant rails into a vertically controlled chain. Circle’sArc, by contrast, places its stablecoin at the center of the system, treating USDC as the protocol’s native fuel and promising lightning-fast settlement with built-in currency exchange.\nGoogle’s approach is different still: the Universal Ledger is designed as a shared infrastructure layer, intended to be credibly neutral and accessible to any institution rather than bound to a single payments ecosystem.\nTimelines also set the projects apart. Circle has already begun piloting Arc, while Stripe is targeting a launch next year. Google and CME, meanwhile, have completed an initial integration of GCUL, with broader testing to follow later this year and full services expected in 2026.\nThe distribution story reinforces those distinctions. Stripe can lean on more than a trillion dollars in annual merchant payment flows. Circle can count on USDC’s global footprint and liquidity integrations. Google brings the reach of its cloud platform, along with the promise of scaling a ledger that can support billions of users and hundreds of institutions.\nFeatures further differentiate the chains. Arc’s focus is speed and seamless foreign exchange, Tempo’s is merchant integration, and GCUL’s is programmability through Python-based smart contracts and institutional-grade tokenization.\nThe result, Widmann argued, is divergent positioning. Stripe’s and Circle’s ledgers may serve their own ecosystems well but risk deterring competitors, while Google is pitching GCUL as neutral ground — a ledger that anyone, from exchanges to payment providers, can use without fear of strengthening a rival.\nThe institutional-first positioning is not new.\nIn March, Google Cloud and CME Group jointlyannouncedGCUL, unveiling it as a programmable distributed ledger tailored for wholesale payments and asset tokenization.\nCME Group said it had already completed the first phase of integration and testing, describing the technology as a potential breakthrough for collateral, settlement, and fee payments in markets that are increasingly moving toward 24/7 trading.\n“As the President and new Administration have encouraged Congress to create landmark legislation for common-sense market structure, we are pleased to partner with Google Cloud to enable innovative solutions for low-cost, digital transfer of value,” CME Chairman and CEO Terry Duffy said at the time. He suggested GCUL could deliver meaningful efficiencies across core market functions, including margin and collateral management.\nAccording to the March announcement, CME and Google plan to begin direct testing with market participants later this year, with an eye to launching services in 2026. Widmann’s Aug. 26 remarks add new detail to that roadmap, reinforcing GCUL’s role as infrastructure designed to be broadly adopted across the financial sector rather than controlled by a single payments company.\nBy positioning GCUL against Stripe’s Tempo and Circle’s Arc, Google is signaling that competition among major technology firms to define the next generation of financial settlement rails is accelerating.\nTechnical details on GCUL’s architecture remain limited, though Widmann said more would be released in the coming months. For now, Google is presenting the Universal Ledger as a foundation for global-scale payments, institutional tokenization and around-the-clock capital markets infrastructure.\nRead More:Why Circle and Stripe(And Many Others)Are Launching Their Own Blockchains",

    "description": "Bitcoin, holding above $111,000 having bounced from lows earlier in the European day, is up less than 1% in 24 hours while the CoinDesk 20 Index has added 3.2%.",
    "content": "Even though bitcoinBTC$107,581.13has bounced from earlier in the European day, it's still up less than 1% in the past 24 hours. With the end of August in touching distance, the largest cryptocurrency seems set to close the month in the red, as it has done for the past three years.\nStill, that's the best August return since 2021, and there are signs in the options market that gains may be coming before the month-end expiry.\nBitcoin and ether optionsworth over $14.6 billionare set to expire Friday with the “max pain” level at $116,000. Max pain is the strike price at which the largest number of options expire worthless, generally causing the greatest financial pain to option holders and greatest benefit to options sellers. That's above the current price, so sellers have an incentive to push BTC higher toward that level to minimize their costs.\nThe CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader market, has added 3.2% in the past 24 hours and the CoinDesk 80, which encompasses a large swathe of smaller tokens, rose 4%.\nFor the longer term, bitcoin's 200-day moving average has just crossed above $100,000. BTC has been trading above the 200-day level since the end of April, underscoring the strength of its long-term uptrend.\nThe 200-day moving average is a long-term trend indicator that smooths price action over roughly six months, helping investors distinguish between bullish and bearish market conditions.\nBitcoin open interest(OI)across top derivatives venues has started to slip, which is in line with the downward price action over the past few days, implying traders are actively exiting their leveraged positions.\nBTC OI now stands at $30.3 billion, just shy of the all time high at $32.6 billion, Velo data shows. Three-month annualized basis is still rising, and is currently 8%- 9% across all exchanges, implying that the basis trade is still profitable.\nIn options, bitcoin's upward-sloping implied volatility curve suggests the market expects long-term volatility to be higher than short-term, while other metrics point to a more immediate bearish outlook.\nSpecifically, the recent move of the 25 delta skew into negative territory for near-term maturities indicates a clear shift in market sentiment, with traders paying a premium for puts over calls to gain downside protection.\nThe bearish sentiment is confirmed by the 24-hour put/call volume, which shows a significant skew towards puts, another sign traders are actively hedging against or speculating on a price decline.\nFunding rate APRs across major perpetual swap venues are starting to bounce back at around 8%-10% annualized, according to Velo data.\nBTC annualized funding on Binance turned negative(-0.39%)for a short period today before bouncing back to around 10%. This indicates that while there may have been pockets of bearish sentiment, the overall market trend is starting to be more supportive by traders willing to pay a premium to bet on a price increase.\nCoinglass data shows $266 million in 24 hour liquidations, skewed 58% towards shorts. ETH($99 million), BTC($47 million)and SOL($20 million)were the leaders in terms of notional liquidations. The Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $111,593 as a core liquidation level to monitor in case of a price rise.\nCronosCRO$0.2793defied Tuesday's bearish crypto sentiment, rallying more than 56% after Crypto.com and Trump Media(DJT)said theyplanned to create a $6.4 billion CRO treasury company.\nCrypto treasury announcements have occurred almost daily over the past month as companies begin to adopt and adapt the approach pioneered by Michael Saylor's Strategy(MSTR).\nStill, the price action often fails to match what might be perceived as a bullish event. When Verb Technology Co.(VERB)announceda $558 million private placement to establish a toncoinTON$3.1178treasury, TON almost immediately fell by around 10%.\nThis CRO deal is different. Firstly it is tied to Trump Media, a company linked to President Donald Trump, but secondly — and arguably more importantly — it gives a use case to the cronos token that was previously used predominately as an exchange token for Crypto.com.\nThe deal includes the creation of a new rewards system on Truth Social that will allow users to convert the platform's “gems” into CRO tokens, with further plans to enable subscription payments and discounted services using CRO.\nBloomberg noted that Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee and also visited Trump's Mar-a-Lago home after the election victory.\nCRO currently trades at $0.225 despite being down at $0.141 last week, the news lifted 24 hour trading volume up by 1,300% to more than $1 billion as it became a market outlier while bitcoin and ether languished near critical levels of support.",

    "title": "Bitcoin Traders Eye Upside as BTC Holds Above $110K: Crypto Daybook Americas",
    "description": "Your day-ahead look for Aug. 27, 2025",
    "content": "By James Van Straten(All times ET unless indicated otherwise)As August draws toward a close, bitcoinBTC$107,581.13bulls may welcome the end of a modest pullback, with the largest cryptocurrency down around 4% for the month and 12% off its all-time high of $124,500.\nFor now, it's little changed around $110,580, up less than 0.5% over 24 hours while ether(ETH)has added 3.4%. The CoinDesk 20 index, a measure of the broader market, rose 2.7% in the same period.\nA negative end to August would halt a streak of four consecutive green months, the longest run since March last year. Encouragingly, August has held up better than in thepast three years, and September should bring a pickup in trading activity as the holiday season winds down.\nOn-chain data shows bitcoin traders used the Short-Term Holder Realized Price(STH-RP), currently $108,800, as support. This metric tracks the average acquisition price of coins moved on-chain in the past 155 days and excludes exchange reserves. In bull markets, the STH RP often acts as a key support level.\nThe Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio(STH-SOPR), which measures profits or losses on coins younger than 155 days, indicates that short-term investors are currently selling at a loss. Historically, this behavior tends to appear near local market bottoms. But capitulation has yet to be seen.\nMeanwhile, theoptions marketpoints to a “max pain” level at $116,000. Max pain is the strike price at which the largest number of options expire worthless, generally causing the greatest financial pain to option holders and greatest benefit to options sellers. With this level above the spot price, it suggests upside relief could be on the horizon.\nBeyond crypto, U.S. trade tensions escalated again as Washington imposed50% tariffs on India, doubling earlier duties after talks broke down. The move, aimed at curbing India’s purchases of Russian oil, highlights strained ties between President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Analysts warn of falling exports, job losses and a potential 1% drag on GDP growth.\nFor bitcoin traders, the key range to watch is $113,500 to $117,200, where theCME futures gapremains open. Historically, such gaps tend to be filled, making this zone one to monitor closely.

When Verb Technology Co.(VERB)announceda $558 million private placement to establish a toncoinTON$3.1165treasury, TON almost immediately fell by around 10%.\nThis CRO deal is different. Firstly it is tied to Trump Media, a company linked to President Donald Trump, but secondly — and arguably more importantly — it gives a use case to the cronos token that was previously used predominately as an exchange token for Crypto.com.\nThe deal includes the creation of a new rewards system on Truth Social that will allow users to convert the platform's “gems” into CRO tokens, with further plans to enable subscription payments and discounted services using CRO.\nBloomberg noted that Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee and also visited Trump's Mar-a-Lago home after the election victory.\nCRO currently trades at $0.225 despite being down at $0.141 last week, the news lifted 24 hour trading volume up by 1,300% to more than $1 billion as it became a market outlier while bitcoin and ether languished near critical levels of support.\nBitcoin open interest(OI)across top derivatives venues has started to slip, which is in line with the downward price action over the past few days, implying traders are actively exiting their leveraged positions.\nBTC OI now stands at $30.3 billion, just shy of the all time high at $32.6 billion, Velo data shows. Three-month annualized basis is still rising, and is currently 8%- 9% across all exchanges, implying that the basis trade is still profitable.\nIn options, bitcoin's upward-sloping implied volatility curve suggests the market expects long-term volatility to be higher than short-term, while other metrics point to a more immediate bearish outlook.\nSpecifically, the recent move of the 25 delta skew into negative territory for near-term maturities indicates a clear shift in market sentiment, with traders paying a premium for puts over calls to gain downside protection.\nThe bearish sentiment is confirmed by the 24-hour put/call volume, which shows a significant skew towards puts, another sign traders are actively hedging against or speculating on a price decline.\nFunding rate APRs across major perpetual swap venues are starting to bounce back at around 8%-10% annualized, according to Velo data.\nBTC annualized funding on Binance turned negative(-0.39%)for a short period today before bouncing back to around 10%. This indicates that while there may have been pockets of bearish sentiment, the overall market trend is starting to be more supportive by traders willing to pay a premium to bet on a price increase.\nCoinglass data shows $266 million in 24 hour liquidations, skewed 58% towards shorts. ETH($99 million), BTC($47 million)and SOL($20 million)were the leaders in terms of notional liquidations. The Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $111,593 as a core liquidation level to monitor in case of a price rise.\nBTC is down 0.34% from 4 p.m. ET Tuesday at $110,981.61(24hrs: +0.72%)\nETH is up 0.41% at $4,605.94(24hrs: +3.56%)\nCoinDesk 20 is up 0.11% at 4,130.44(24hrs: +3.15%)\nEther CESR Composite Staking Rate is down 2 bps at 2.93%\nBTC funding rate is at 0.0076%(8.3297% annualized)on Binance\nDXY is up 0.37% at 98.59\nGold futures are unchanged at $3,431.20\nSilver futures are down 0.65% at $38.35\nNikkei 225 closed up 0.3% at 42,520.27\nHang Seng closed down 1.27% at 25,201.76\nFTSE is unchanged at 9,273.12\nEuro Stoxx 50 is up 0.16% at 5,392.10\nDJIA closed on Tuesday up 0.3% at 45,418.07\nS&P 500 closed up 0.41% at 6,465.94\nNasdaq Composite closed up 0.44% at 21,544.27\nS&P/TSX Composite closed up 0.6% at 28,339.88\nS&P 40 Latin America closed down 0.43% at 2,715.37\nU.S. 10-Year Treasury rate is up 1.5 bps at 4.271%\nE-mini S&P 500 futures are unchanged at 6,485.25\nE-mini Nasdaq-100 futures are unchanged at 23,596.00\nE-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average Index are unchanged at 45,516.00\nBTC Dominance: 58.03%(-0.29%)\nEther-bitcoin ratio: 0.04129(0.32%)\nHashrate(seven-day moving average): 960 EH/s\nHashprice(spot): $54.07\nTotal fees: 3.19 BTC / $351,661\nCME Futures Open Interest: 137,600 BTC\nBTC priced in gold: 32.8 oz.\nBTC vs gold market cap: 9.28%\nThe SOL-BTC weekly chart is approaching a key resistance level that, at the moment, is looking likely to be broken.\nThis SOL strength is more of a result of a bullish RSI divergence that seems to be already in play, as confirmed by the magnitude of the move.\nThe ratio acts as a good proxy for the strength of altcoins in general, and a confirmed break in the pair would signal continued strength in select altcoins relative to BTC.\nStrategy(MSTR): closed on Tuesday at $351.36(+2.38%), -0.6% at $349.26 in pre-market\nCoinbase Global(COIN): closed at $308.48(+0.81%), -0.28% at $307.62\nCircle(CRCL): closed at $129.05(+3.04%), -0.46% at $128.45\nGalaxy Digital(GLXY): closed at $24.72(+0.69%), +0.36% at $24.81\nBullish(BLSH): closed at $66.08(+1.38%), -0.42% at $65.80\nMARA Holdings(MARA): closed at $15.84(+2.86%), -0.63% at $15.74\nRiot Platforms(RIOT): closed at $13.69(+3.09%), -0.88% at $13.57\nCore Scientific(CORZ): closed at $14.04(+2.63%), +0.36% at $14.09\nCleanSpark(CLSK): closed at $9.68(+2.43%), -0.41% at $9.64\nCoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF(WGMI): closed at $29.39(+2.73%)\nSemler Scientific(SMLR): closed at $30.79(+2.56%)\nExodus Movement(EXOD): closed at $26.98(+2.74%)\nSharpLink Gaming(SBET): closed at $19.92(+3.91%), -1.2% at $19.68\nDaily net flows: $88.1 million\nCumulative net flows: $54.08 billion\nTotal BTC holdings ~1.29 million\nDaily net flows: $455 million\nCumulative net flows: $13.34 billion\nTotal ETH holdings ~6.43 million\nIn August, creation of Ethena's USDe stablecoin reached a record high, with over $3.78 billion in new supply.\nUSDe's total circulating supply has now climbed past $12 billion, solidifying its position as the third-largest stablecoin by market capitalization.\nThe monthly growth notably outpaced the $3.4 billion issuance of Tether's market-leading USDT for the same period.\nUnified Crypto Lobbyists: Protect Software Developers, Senate, or We're Out(CoinDesk): Over 110 organizations, builders and investors told U.S. senators they can’t support the Clarity Act unless software developers and non-custodial service providers are shielded from liability when bad actors misuse their technology.\nHealth-Care Firm KindlyMD Plans $5B Equity Raise for Bitcoin Treasury(CoinDesk): Shares of the company, which recently merged with bitcoin treasury firm Nakamoto, slid 12% Tuesday after unveiling plans to raise up to $5 billion through an at-the-money equity sale.\nMetaplanet Shares Jump 6% on International Stock Sale, Financing Moves(CoinDesk): The Japanese firm will seek 130.3 billion yen($880 million)from an international share sale, primarily for bitcoin purchases, while suspending warrant exercises and redeeming bonds early to bolster its balance sheet.\nMarkets Need Rules — Crypto Is No Different(Financial Times): Scott Duke Kominers, a professor at Harvard Business School, says crypto markets need rules to ensure predictability, property rights, transparency and fair competition, arguing that without them innovation falters and speculation dominates.\nPutin Acts Like He Doesn’t Care About Peace.

    "content": "BitcoinBTC$107,581.13long-term holders(LTHs)have already realized more profit in this cycle than in all but one previous cycle(2016 to 2017), according to data from on-chain analytics platformGlassnode.\nThis underscores elevated sell-side pressure and, when combined with other signals, suggests the market has entered the late phase of the cycle\".\nSince the start of 2024, LTHs(defined as investors who have held bitcoin for at least 155 days)have realized 3.27 million BTC in profits. This figure has now surpassed the 2021 bull run(just over 3 million BTC)and is far ahead of the 2013 cycle. However, it still trails the 2017 bull run, when realized profits reached 3.93 million BTC.\nFor context, bitcoin’s average price was around $1,000 in 2015, compared with today’s levels which are roughly 100 times higher. This highlights that the market has absorbed a significantly larger dollar value of realized profits. The sell-side supply has been enormous, with ongoing rotation of capital, including from long-dormant \"OG\" coins.\nRecent market activity illustrates this dynamic: approximately 80,000 BTC was listed for sale atGalaxy, while another 26,000 BTC recently became active.\nAltogether, about 100,000 BTC has come up for sale and the market has seen a slight correction, which shows how liquid the market has become. Exchange-traded funds(ETFs)have played a role in facilitating this rotation, while trading volumes have also expanded broadly across the market.",

    "description": "Lobbyists and firms such as Coinbase, Kraken and Ripple told key senators the sector can't support a market structure bill without software developer protection.",
    "content": "The crypto industry's Washington lobbyists are trying to draw a line in the sand over the market structure bill that's steaming through the U.S. Senate, saying they can't back a law that wouldn't fully protect software developers from being held responsible for bad actors abusing their technology.\nThe industry made its case to the Senate's Banking and Agriculture committees \"with one voice,\" sending a letter Wednesday signed by Coinbase, Kraken, Ripple, a16z, Uniswap Labs and more than a hundred other crypto businesses and organizations, including almost all of the major U.S. lobbying groups. This unified effort comes the week before the Senate gets back to work, and likely rekindles full negotiations on the language of the legislation that represents the industry's top U.S. goal.\n\"Provide robust, nationwide protections for software developers and non-custodial service providers in market structure legislation,\" the letter said. \"Without such protections, we cannot support a market structure bill.\"\nA bill to regulate how crypto is overseen in the U.S. has alreadypassed the U.S. House of Representativesin a version known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act. It's now in the hands of the Senate, where Senator Tim Scott, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee had vowed for months the lawmakers would finish work by the end of September.\n\"No group is more important to this country’s digital financial future than the software developers building it,\" said Amanda Tuminelli, executive director of the DeFi Education Fund, in a statement. \"In the largest crypto advocacy coalition in history, over 110 organizations, builders and investors came together with DEF to ask congressional leaders to protect software developers and non-custodial service providers in federal market structure legislation.\nAs the lawmakers get back to the bill after their August recess, the industry wants them to consider this central point:\n\"It is critical that legislation recognizes and preserves the historical protections afforded to open-source software development, and ensures that software developers and non-custodial service providers who create, support, and enable access to decentralized networks are not forced into unworkable regulatory categories designed for the traditional, intermediated financial world,\" according to the letter, led by the DEF and joined by the Blockchain Association, Digital Chamber, Crypto Council for Innovation, Solana Policy Institute and many others.\nA few years ago, such an argument may have fallen on deaf ears in Washington, but these same companies have become a political powerhouse, largely throughamassing funds at a political action committee— Fairshake and its affiliate PACs — that expended more than $130 million in last year's congressional elections and has so far gathered more than $140 million for next year's.\nSo far this year, crypto's congressional progress has been unprecedented, with huge bipartisan votes on crypto-related action, culminating with the approval of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins(GENIUS)Act to oversee stablecoin issuers.\nBut the market structure bill is expected to be the sector's greatest test. While the Clarity Act included developer safeguards, lobbyists havealready grown concernedthat Senator Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, will press for some legal liabilities on crypto software creators. And the courts have also added pressure, with federal prosecutors recently obtaining convictions in multiple high-profile developer cases — most notably, that of Tornado Cash and Roman Storm.\nThe industry did welcome the recent remarks from a senior Department of Justice official that their prosecutorswon't be chasing crypto developerswho aren't intentionally getting into money laundering, only a new law can give permanent assurance.\nRead More:Roman Storm Guilty of Unlicensed Money Transmitting Conspiracy in Partial Verdict",

    "content": "Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, seeCoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.\nETH's chances of hitting $5,000 this month climbed to 26% on Polymarket, up from 16% just a few days ago, as traders priced in momentum from institutional accumulation and shifting BTC-ETH flows.\n“Ethereum’s recent strength is mainly showcased by the level of flows into it, where a major liquidity floor has been built by institutions,” said March Zheng, General Partner at Bizantine Capital in a note to CoinDesk.\nHe added that the ETH/BTC ratio had been sitting at a localized low, making a rebound overdue, and that this cycle is supported by stronger fundamentals such as global stablecoin adoption and clearer regulation.\nMarket rotation added further color to the rally, Enflux, a market maker, wrote to CoinDesk in a note. XRP joined ETH in leading the majors, while capital chased new narratives, such as CRO, followingTrump Media’s “Cronos Treasury” initiative.\nHyperliquid’s surge in trading volume, surpassing Robinhood in July, highlighted how retail speculation is tilting toward native infrastructure, with its $HYPE token gaining double digits. These undercurrents suggest that what matters most is not the day’s closing print but the structural reallocation of liquidity across the crypto landscape, Enflux noted.\nLiquidity is being redistributed across the crypto landscape, market observers say, but ETH’s role at the center is reinforced by institutional conviction.\n“Markets react to headlines, but longer-term value is driven by fundamentals,\" Gracie Lin, CEO of OKX Singapore, told CoinDesk in a note.\n\"This is why Ethereum continues to show strength through real utility — even as prices pull back, big institutional moves like BitMine’s ETH accumulation prove there’s deep conviction in its role at the core of crypto,\" Lin continued. \"With new macro data like the US PCE coming in later this week, we’re about to see how that conviction holds up amidst volatility.”\nETH has outpaced BTC by a wide margin, gaining 20% over the past 30 days compared to bitcoin’s 6% decline, market data shows, and trading volumes show ETH commanding more liquidity than BTC despite its smaller market cap.\nBTC:Bitcoin is trading at $111,733.63, but weak on-chain activity and $940M in liquidations signal fading momentum.\nETH:Ether is trading at $4,598.67, below its recent all-time high of $4,946, as institutional inflows power the rally while DeFi activity and TVL remain weaker than in past cycles.\nGold:Gold is trading at $3,410.80, holding above $3,400 as Powell’s rate-cut hints, Trump’s Fed shake-up, and record central bank buying fuel safe-haven demand with traders eyeing a run toward $3,500.\nNikkei 225:Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell Wednesday despite Wall Street’s overnight gains, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.17%.\nS&P 500:The S&P 500 rose 0.41% to 6,465.94 on Tuesday as investors looked past Trump’s removal of Fed Governor Lisa Cook and awaited Nvidia’s earnings.\nTrump-backed World Liberty Token Could Decimate Retail Investors, Compass Point Warns (Decrypt)\nU.S. CFTC, a Top Crypto Watchdog, Is About to Shrink Commission to Only One Member (CoinDesk)\nBitcoin Miner Hut 8 Surges 10% on 1.5GW Expansion Plans (CoinDesk)",

    "content": "Altcoins bounced back sharply on Tuesday after a steep sell-off over the prior 48 hours, with traders seizing lower prices as an opportunity to re-enter the market.\nXRP led the recovery, gaining 6% over the past 24 hours. SolanaSOL$198.31and dogecoinDOGE$0.2101each climbed about 4.5%, while ethereumETH$4,380.02added 5% over the same period. Open interest across these tokens also ticked higher, signaling renewed speculative activity. XRP once again stood out, with its open interest rising 4.2% in the past day.\nThe uptick comes as CME Groupannounced earlier Tuesdaythat its crypto futures suite surpassed $30 billion in notional open interest for the first time. SOL and XRP futures each crossed the $1 billion mark, with XRP becoming the fastest contract to reach that level—doing so in just over three months. Analysts see this milestone as evidence of market maturity and growing institutional participation in crypto derivatives, not to mention the sort of interest a spot XRP ETF might generate.\n\"Think people might be underestimating demand for spot XRP ETFs,\"wrote ETF expert Nate Geraci.\nThe broader market also strengthened, with the CoinDesk 20 Index(CD20)up 3.6% on Tuesday. BitcoinBTC$107,581.13lagged behind, gaining only about 1%, but did cross back over the $111,000 mark after dropping below $109,000 at one point hours earlier.\nBoth bitcoin and ether hit record highs earlier this month, lifted by expectations of monetary easing and increased institutional demand. Yet sentiment may be running too hot, according to blockchain analytics firmSantiment. In a report published Sunday, the firm warned that optimism around a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in September has reached levels that often precede corrections.\n“While optimism about a rate cut is fueling the market, social data suggests caution is warranted,” Santiment said, pointing to a spike in online chatter around the Fed decision. The firm cautioned that if expectations of easing fail to materialize, the market could see a “swift correction.”\nTraders are now watching Friday’s release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures(PCE)Price Index as a key signal for the Fed’s next move.",

    "description": "Democrat Kristin Johnson's exit means the crypto regulator will fall to a single commissioner, Acting Chairman Caroline Pham, as Trump's pick awaits the Senate.",
    "content": "The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is about to drop to a single commissioner when Democrat Kristin Johnson leaves the agency next week, and the only other person waiting in the wings to join the regulator is President Donald Trump's chairman nominee, Brian Quintenz.\nAs of Sept. 3, the five-member commission will drop to one, because that's when Johnson will exit, she said in a Tuesday announcement.\n\"In advancing an agenda in the name of growth, it is critical not to dismantle the foundational resilience that supports financial stability and protects the broader economy,\" she said in a farewell statement encouraging the agency to stick to the fundamentals as new technologies come on board.\nAlone at the commissioner level will be Acting Chairman Caroline Pham, acrypto advocatewho Trump appointed to run the agency while he sought a permanent chair. Trump's pick was ultimately former Commissioner Brian Quintenz, who has worked as a policy chief at a16z and for prediction market firm Kalshi. But the White House delayed Quintenz's confirmation process, leaving it in some uncertainty as the Senate returns from its summer recess next week.\nThe nominee has beenopenly opposed by Tyler Winklevoss, the CEO of crypto exchange Gemini and one of Trump's favored crypto insiders, but much of the industry recently petitioned Trump tospeed Quintenz toward a confirmation.\nThe CFTC is the U.S. regulator of derivatives markets, though it's awaiting congressional action to give it the power to police the spot market in crypto commodities, such as bitcoinBTC$107,581.13. The agency has already been a major player in U.S. crypto oversight, having pushed a number of major enforcement actions and led discussions on how to incorporate the crypto sector's innovations into the massive global commodities markets.\nIf Quintenz replaces Pham atop the agency, she's said she intends to leave and return to the private sector.\nThat'll mean Quintenz would helm the commission solo, short four members, and Trump has so far shown no signs of nominating others. The president's administration has been characterized by a campaign to cut Democrats away from regulatory commissions, abandoning the tradition — and legal mandate — of having both parties involved in decisions at federal agencies. Quintenz has said he'll move forward withwhatever choices Trump makes.\nThough some have argued that letting a five-person commission drop to one could make it vulnerable to legal challenges on its policy moves, there's nothing specific in the law that prohibits the regulator from continuing on that basis. It arguably streamlines the review of new rules to a single office rather than five, but the work of writing the eventual crypto regulations could already be hampered by the significant staff cuts seen since the Trump administration began reducing the federal workforce.\nRead More:While CFTC Awaits New Chairman, Acting Chief Pham Gets Rolling on Crypto",

    "description": "The lawmaker's objections over crypto abuses are seen as a major hurdle needing to be cleared before the Senate's crypto market structure bill can move.",
    "content": "One of the crypto industry's central lobbying aims — to protect software developers from being held legally responsible when criminals abuse their technology — may be in jeopardy from Democrats led by U.S. Senator Mark Warner, according to people familiar with legislative negotiations.\nThe Senate is set to return to work in Washington next week, with the completion of a crypto market structure bill as one of its top agenda items. In the discussions over that bill, Warner is said to have held reservations about the approach in the U.S. House of Representatives’ version of the bill known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which gave developerslegal cover, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiation.\nWarner, a Virginia Democrat who is the vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, maintains a close focus on national security issues, and he's said to have balked at the rampant hacks and money laundering concerns that he's associated with the decentralized finance(DeFi)end of the crypto sector. In the past, he'sraised objections over reportsthat cryptocurrency may have been used to move assets to terrorist groups, and hepushed a bill in 2023that looked to saddle DeFi platforms with the same anti-money laundering(AML)requirements that traditional finance firms must meet — a potentially existential threat to the way the decentralized projects operate without core management.\nBack then, Warner said such an effort would \"help maintain the robust AML and sanctions enforcement we need to protect our national security, while allowing participants who play by the rules to continue to take advantage of the potential of distributed ledger technologies,\" additionally noting his views that \"criminals and rogue states continue to use crypto to launder money, evade sanctions, and conceal illicit activity.\"\nThen hepursued an appropriations provision last yearthat would have automated a process to sanction \"foreign digital asset transaction facilitators\" – including crypto exchanges – linked to users who support terrorism groups. So he has a background in seeking to hold digital assets insiders responsible for the illicit use of their products.\nWarner has, however, demonstrated a willingness to also get on board with bipartisan, pro-crypto issues, as seen with his approval of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins(GENIUS)Act\n\"With the GENIUS Act, the Senate was able to come together in a bipartisan fashion to tackle major issues related to illicit finance, consumer protection and market stability,\" Warner said in a Tuesday statement emailed to CoinDesk. \"As we head into the fall, I look forward to working in a bipartisan manner to help address the same pressing issues related to market structure legislation.\"\nWarner is among the Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee — one of the two panels that needs to come to agreement on the crypto legislation before it can move on to a floor vote. With Tuesday's comments, Republican senators who have been seeking to fast-track the Senate's market structure bill now have his open invitation to negotiate a followup to the House's wide, bipartisan approval of a market structure bill.\nUnlike with the more aggressive stance of fellow Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren, the industry generally sees Warner as a member with a balanced view on crypto issues, having supported the sector in previous votes, beyond just the passage of the bill to regulate U.S. stablecoin issuers — the industry's biggest achievement in Washington. Digital assets political organization Stand With Crypto gives himan \"A\" gradeas a lawmaker who \"strongly supports crypto.\"\nWhen the GENIUS Act was still moving through the Senate before itspassage by a wide marginin June, some Democrats hadhalted the process on that bill to objectto security and illicit-finance aspects of the industry(in addition to the potential conflicts posed by President Donald Trump's own stablecoin business interests.)The disagreements were kicked down the road in favor of an easy passage of that earlier bill, with the knowledge that this market structure legislation would be a better place to hash out those concerns.\nThat debate is now arriving for the bill that's the lynchpin of the digital assets sector's Washington plans. This legislation to set out tailored regulations for U.S. crypto transactions is seen as necessary for the industry to come into its own and to bring remaining institutional players and hesitant retail investors into the realm of digital tokens.\nBehind closed doors, crypto lobbyists are wondering if Warner's background in venture-capital work for technology firms will help them make a case for protecting software-writing innovators from legal liability. In light of cases such as Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm'srecent criminal conviction, the urgency to establish a shield is amplifying.\nRead More:Roman Storm Guilty of Unlicensed Money Transmitting Conspiracy in Partial VerdictUPDATE(August 26, 2025, 23:28 UTC):Adds comment from Senator Warner.",

That includes borrowing against its 10,000 BTC stash worth roughly $1.1 billion, a $200 million revolving credit line, an expanded $130 million facility from Coinbase and a recently launched $1 billion at-the-market equity offering.\nInvestment bank Roth Capital viewed the expansion plans as a \"notable step-up,\" with potential to \"materially re-rate the stock\" as the sites come online and get contracted for AI and high-performance computing.\nRead more:Bitcoin Mining Faces 'Incredibly Difficult' Market as Power Becomes the Real Currency",

    "description": "Derivative milestone comes as spot XRP weathers sharp $2.96–$2.84 swing on 217 million volume and institutional flows step back in.",
    "content": "CME Group said its crypto futures suite has surpassed $30 billion in notional open interest for the first time, with SOL and XRP futures each crossing $1 billion. XRP became the fastest contract to hit the milestone, doing so in just over three months.\nThe development is viewed as a signal of market maturity and new institutional capital entering derivatives.\nBroader crypto markets remained firm into late August, though regulatory overhang in the U.S. has continued to pressure XRP relative to peers.\nCorporate adoption trends and pilot remittance programs keep XRP in focus for treasury desks, even as volatility spikes test investor conviction.\nXRP traded through a 5% range between $2.98 and $2.84 in the 24-hour session ending August 26 at 14:00.\nThe steepest move occurred on August 25 during evening hours, when XRP dropped from $2.96 to $2.84 on 217.58 million tokens — triple its 72.45 million daily average.\nThe token rebounded to $2.92, with the $2.84 level emerging as critical support as institutional flows stepped in.\nIn the final hour of trading, XRP rose 0.7% from $2.90 to $2.92 on more than 5.7 million volume, signaling fresh corporate and fund participation.\nSupport confirmed at $2.84 with high-volume absorption of sell pressure.\nResistance remains at $2.94–$2.95, with repeated profit-taking capping upside attempts.\nRSI climbed from oversold 42 back into mid-50s, suggesting stabilizing momentum.\nMACD histogram tightening, indicative of potential bullish crossover in coming sessions.\nWeekly momentum divergence patterns point to compressed volatility, setting up for a directional breakout.\nOrder books show concentrated institutional bids above $3.60, signaling strategic positioning ahead of regulatory catalysts.\nBulls see $3.70 as the next upside target if $2.90–$2.92 base holds.\nBears flag $2.80 as the downside trigger, with a break below support likely to accelerate losses.\nDerivatives flows now dominate the backdrop: CME’s $1B open interest in XRP futures will be a key barometer of institutional conviction.",
